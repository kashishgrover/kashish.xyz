Only with a prescience that has legendarily been attributed to Nostradamus would a doctor from the sixteenth century be able to predict the technological marvels that permeate the hospitals of the modern age. Even as our knowledge of the myriad ways in which the human body may fail increases, so does our prowess in restoring it to the optimum state.

Pancreatic cancer has risen as a scourge of indeterminate size, having defied mere classification for an extraordinarily long time. Dr. Indraneil Mukherjee illustrated technological advancements via our approach towards this terrible disorder. From diagnostic tools such as 3D visualization, to treatments such as cryoablation and robot assisted surgeries with the incorporation of pre­surgery habilitation, even the once feared Whipple procedure has now become startlingly tame.
