<span style="font-weight: 400">The simple motto emblazoned onto the blackboard was enough to bring smiles to everyone’s faces as they sat in anticipation, awaiting the inaugural meeting of Manipal’s first ever Gaming Club. And anticipation it was, because the meeting in question had an attendance of enough people, to put most EVS lectures to shame. Here is MTTN’s comprehensive explanation of what the MIT Gaming Club is about.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The club itself is divided into two wings: Game Development and E-Sports (open to all). Besides these, there is a separate Managing Committee as well, which is exclusively open to second years.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The GDW, which is the more serious of the two, has their finger in more research related and technical focuses. Their work is more set towards fields like game engine analysis, development of games and workshops even. The department itself sounds like a dream come true for the hardcore gamers looking to delve into their roots and maybe even put together something new. In the long run, the club wants to develop and commercialize games in the hope of becoming one among the leading brands in the field.</span>

<a href="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/DSC_9259.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-1245"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1245" src="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/DSC_9259.jpg" alt="DSC_9259" width="190" height="127" /></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400">The ESW on the other hand is more involved in promoting gaming and organizing an assortment of events and fests to help launch a more gaming friendly year. For all the gaming fanatics looking to take it to the next level or even for the casual gamer, watch out for the E-Sports Wing and their promise of gaming fests, tournaments, game analysis, info sessions and training. So if you’re a casual gamer looking to be the next stuff of legend, your time has come.</span>

<a href="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/DSC_9274.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-1246"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1246" src="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/DSC_9274.jpg" alt="DSC_9274" width="190" height="127" /></a>

<span style="font-weight: 400">For all the gamers out there, this club may be one to watch out for. So step up, Manipal, it’s time to respawn your passion.</span>
