It is said that if you have the courage to dream, the passion to realize the dreams and the will to toil for them, then sky is the limit. Mr. Komal, aged all but 18 years, epitomized this utopic citizen. He spoke about his invention, a device to sense the concentration of carbon monoxide in the ambient air using nanotechnology. Brimming with uncorrupted energy and raw excitement, he narrated his meetings with Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam and visits to the White House in a bid to promote his work. The audience listened with rapt attention as he reveled in the pride of getting to represent India on various international platforms. It was truly an eye-opener for all, a beckoning to stop being lazy and strive for success.
