Can you name the Captain of Indian Cricket Team in the match where the opposing team has Russell as the Captain and Burton, Yardley, Smith, Brooks as some of the players?

If you could recall the game played in the movie ‘<i>Lagaan´ </i>and answered ‘<i>Bhuvan’</i>, Atulya Bharat: The India Quiz was just for you! The event had an overflow of participants who did appear knowledgeable enough to answer if asked anything about Bollywood or Cricket or Politics and everything else that’s related to Hindustan.

The Prelims began with a question to the gamers about AC Chronicles and went on to cover everything ingenious. The twenty-five questions made the auditorium go in awe sometimes, amazed at others. The questions made everyone lose their minds, as they knew they were close but not accurate. At times, some smarty pants objected to the giving of hints by the quizmaster. Soon after the prelims, the answers were displayed and some disappointed participants could be seen leaving the room quietly. The results were announced and the top six teams went on-stage to fight for the ultimate cash prize.

Before beginning the real game, the host spoke beautiful lines in Hindi about celebrating the language we speak and the nation we live in that brought everyone’s hands together. The finale had various rounds like the Infinite Pounce and buzzer round, the questions of which kept the participants on their toes. In one such interesting round "Bujho Toh Jaane", the participants had to guess the Indian movie based on the minimalistic poster shown. In other rounds, it was a thrill to see questions about the origin of Old Monk near Delhi and also about the time when the NDA government resigned after just 13 days.  The event also had audience questions with recharge coupons given out the correct responses. Halfway through the Finale, the competition grew severe among four of the six teams. But ultimately the smartest kids took the cash prize home, celebrating the knowledge they were proud of and the country they were proud of.
