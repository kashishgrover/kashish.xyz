<blockquote>While she trotted down the streets in anguish, careful not to step into the puddles of water, one hand over her head like a desperate seeker of shelter from the tumultuous rain; he quietly sneaked up to her. Holding his umbrella above her, he greeted her with the first smile of Monsoon. At that moment, while she caught the face of her savior, every joy in life seemed unparalleled. Suddenly it seemed like it was <em>her</em> rain, the rain sent from above for her to relish a moment’s bliss with that boy who sat miles apart from her in class, whose gaze she met now and then, and whom she longed to know.</blockquote>
The comfort that the first drop of rain brings you after four months of unbearable heat is priceless. It unifies the general populace into leaving their blocks and running out to greet the advent of another unending monsoon. One learns to embrace this season instead of complaining about it; it instills in you the belief that you have an intimate connection with this place. Very soon, beautiful pictures fill your news feed--and the monsoons weave a story like no other. Every year the monsoons arrive right amidst the even semester’s finals and go on right till the end of odd semester. Manipal is well known to connect the best with the worst-- while you are struggling with those scary exams, the weather outside will constantly urge you to fall in love with it, give up your education and run to the mountains.

Do you ever wonder what makes the Manipal rains so famous? For most, it is symbolic of life. Life is just as impulsive, unpredictable and unstoppable. Just when you think you've mastered the way to live it, it surprises you. You especially adore how the clear blue sky is suddenly filled up with dark clouds, and at a moment’s notice it’s raining torrentially. You love the fact that right when you’ve opened your huge umbrella, satisfied at the investment-- the rains disappear and the sun comes out shining, laughing at your naïve attempt. You love how the rains unify everyone: people scattered on the road immediately run to the nearest umbrellas and are forced to make awkward conversation. But most of all you love those days when you forget to take the umbrella with you. It reminds you of everything you stand for- wildness, freedom and especially the euphoria that drives you. Even now you know- these are the days that will be vividly etched in your mind years later.

The Manipal rains are a necessity. Not only do they keep the stifling heat at bay but also magnify the beautiful colors all around you. Spotting a rainbow here is very frequent. One can truly appreciate how magnificent the town is only after it has rained. The mountains half absorbed in clouds while you wake up for an 8 am class will never fail to amaze you. It is these rains that give you butterflies in your stomach when you are particularly euphoric. You detest those nights when the incessant patter reminds you of all the painful memories driving sleep away. It's what sets this place apart from anywhere else, and while you might complain about it all the time- it is this one thing about the place nobody can ever take away from you. The rains are both a blessing and a curse. They might crawl up to you unexpectedly on a sunny day, but they never fail to comfort you.

The rains never stop anyone from anything. It could be having a <em>Dandiya</em> night convert into a rain dance, or simply having to dry all your notebooks for days because you just didn’t have a waterproof bag. It could mean getting wet with your friends and then getting fever for a whole week (75% attendance:take note) or being particularly careless and spending half your pocket money on a dozen umbrellas. But what’s special about the Manipal rains is that they reward everyone with a feeling of change, entropy, and the sense of belonging to this place in some weird, kind way. While you crawl into bed with the inevitable laziness that a cloudy day brings, you cannot help but appreciate the beautiful place you’ve come to call your second home. And while everyone is busy with life- classes, exams, placements: Manipal promises to remain home forever. Home of the first love in the monsoons, first heartbreak on an apocalyptic day, first failure in life or the first ever job offer that overwhelmed you with a glorious downpour and brought with it a reassurance that everything will indeed be alright. Thus, while you're still here- throw that half broken umbrella away and embrace the rains for once. It might not be the best idea ever, but you won't regret it.
