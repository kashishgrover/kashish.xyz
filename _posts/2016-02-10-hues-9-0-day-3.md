Day 3 of Hues 9.0 saw an eclectic mix of both literary and cultural events. Not only were there a large number of enthusiastic participants, but also a very interesting array of cultural performances, poetry recitations and inspired written work.

<strong>POETRY (HINDI AND ENGLISH)</strong>

Poetry seems like a rather odd competition for people who spend their lives staring at teeth and yet the event saw not only a great turnout but also a number of heartwarming submissions and recitations. The event was divided into two categories - Hindi and English.

The topics for Hindi poetry were ‘Nanhi Kali - Betiyan’ and ‘Baarish ki vo pehli bund’ and were judged by Dr. Arvind, Dr. Komal and Dr. Abhishek. The winners were:-

1st - Shruti Sharma (Final year) and Shreya (TIPS)

2nd - Priyansha (Thrid year)

3rd- Tanushree (Third year)

The topics for English poetry were 'Life Choices', 'Whispers of Night' and 'Then it was all Yellow' and the judges were Dr. Monica Soloman and Dr. Raghu. The prizes were bagged by:-

1st- Shweta Purohit (First year), Arunendra (TIPS), Neha (TIPS)

2nd- Krithika Shastry (Second year) and Prabhjeet (Third year)

3rd- Balram (Final year)

<strong>SPOT PHOTOGRAPHY</strong>

Elliot Erwitt once said, "Photography is an art of observation. It has little to do with things you see and everything to do with the way you see them."

Day 3 of MCODS' cultural fest kick-started with one of the most awaited events (atleast by the budding photographers of the college!) 12 participants brought out their lenses to exhibit their powers of perception and composition on two themes - Leading Lines and Water. Each participant was given three hours and three submissions. The competition was judged by Dr. Kiran Acharya and Dr. Deepika.

Results - to be announced.

<strong>BODY ART</strong>

Bringing still images to life at its vibrant best is the stock of any artist's trade, but when the canvas ascends a dimension, so does their art. The body art event posed unique challenges, overcome in spectacular fashion by the contestants. Illusive blends of color, light, and the smiling canvases, gave rise to beautiful works of art. The judges for this event were Dr. Vineetha and Dr. Sunita.

To see the world around us is to see how things are. 'Installation' demanded of its contestants to see how the world could be. Everyday items such as soft-drink bottles and coconuts came together and fulfilled the artistic visions of the competing teams.

<strong>CREATIVE WRITING</strong>

This year, Hues 9.0, featured contests for both English and Hindi Creative Writing. The participating writers were given an hour to prove their prowess. They were devoid of the constraints of a word limit. The participants in the Hindi contest had to write on the significance of freedom or on national unity. The participants in the English contest were afforded three different situations out of which they had to essay a story on it. While majority of the entries received were well appreciated by the judges, in the end the winners were as follows:

Creative Writing (Hindi):
First: Tanushree
Second: Shreya
Third: Shilpi
The results for the English contest are yet to be announced.

<strong>TURNCOAT</strong>

The word ‘turncoat’ means a person who deserts one party or cause in order to join an opposing one. That is exactly what the contestants in this event had to do. They had to switch between supporting a cause and opposing it as and when the judges told them to. Some of the causes they had to support and oppose were ‘The fairer sex is really fair’, ‘Western music is better than Indian music’ and ‘Democracy is better than Dictatorship’.

This event that required intelligence and quick thinking was judged by Dr. Rupali and Dr. Shruti.

Winners to be announced.

<strong>EASTERN SOLO SINGING</strong>

One of the most anticipated events of the evening saw music fanatics fill the air with their mellifluous

singing. The event was judged by Dr. Sudha and Dr. Subraya Bhat (Associate Dean- MCODS, Manipal).

Winners:

1st- Kasturi (TIPS)

2nd- Swagata Saha (2ndyear) and Sahitya Ambesh (4thYear)
