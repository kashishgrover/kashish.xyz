<div><strong>DEBATE</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>The Verve'16 Debate saw participants from various semesters, arguing the motion "Ethical objections to stem cell research should not result in it being disavowed." Judged by Dr Punja and Dr Deepak, the debate was of the 3+1 minutes format. The event, held in Interact,<span style="font-size: medium"> saw speakers talking about the ethical dilemmas faced when embryos are harvested for research. The proposition had speakers arguing the importance of pre-existing life over potential life. The opposition, on the other hand, expounded on how a life in an earlier stage is equally important as that in a later stage of development. </span><span style="font-size: medium">There were arguments that explored the benefits of stem cell research, the disadvantages and the ethical question. As all good debates, the event was characterized by rhetoric, powerful arguments and strong counter-arguments.</span></div>

<strong>PAINTING</strong>

Painting is not just making random lines on paper with colors. It is a confluence of art and emotion, a way of unleashing the inner thinker, an outlet for one’s feelings. Each painting has a story of its own, some visible, some invisible.

The Painting competition as apart of verve sought to bring forth these hidden stories in artists’ minds. In two hours, students wove magic with paints as they depicted their takes on “why so serious?” OR “casino”. The creative juices flowed as each person strived to bring their thoughts alive on paper. Indeed, the judges, Dr. Swapna (Dept. of Pharmacology) and Dr. Abhyu (Intern) had a hard time choosing the best ones.

<div dir="ltr"><strong>POTPOURRI</strong></div>
<div dir="ltr">
<div dir="ltr"></div>
<div dir="ltr">Easily the most entertaining and exciting event of Verve '16, Potpourri was off to an exuberant start. The Prelims was an elimination round comprised of events such as Taboo, What's the Good Word and Pictionary. The teams of three had to write down the answers to the drawings and homonyms which their team members had jotted down or drawn. Each member of the team was allowed 7 minutes. Six teams moved on to the final round, which was divided into three parts. The first round was Charades but with an interesting twist. One member had to draw the clue for the second, who had to act it out to the third.The other two team members had to guess all six characters and guess what connects them. The next part was a modified version of Taboo, called Chaos. One member from each team was given a movie character and had to shout out the clue to all the teams for them to guess. The twist in this was firstly, it was taboo and secondly, all six members had to shout at the same time resulting in commotion. The final part was a modified form of 20 questions. The event was filled with Tarantino references; movies like Gone With the Wind and Twelve Monkeys left the participants scratching their heads in the heat of the moment. The event was successfully and dynamically conducted by Ankita, Aakash and Abhay.</div>
