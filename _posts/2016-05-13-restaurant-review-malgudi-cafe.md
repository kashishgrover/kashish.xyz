<em><strong>The Experience:</strong></em>

South Indian cuisine is pretty polarizing, you either abhor it or love it to the ends of the earth. If you are the second type, Manipal and Udupi has a lot to offer. One such eatery is Malgudi Cafe, located in the heart of Udupi, near KSRTC bus stand. Ask any rickshaw driver for a ride to Polar Bear since they are located under the same roof. It is a quaint little place and has all the promise of a wonderful place to eat and spend time.

&nbsp;

The menu is extensive, a positive for those looking to step ahead of the ordinary. It offers 35 different kinds of dosas, pizzas, soft drinks and assorted items.

&nbsp;

The presentation is unique, definitely arousing one’s taste buds in a trice. The dosas not only look splendid but also taste amazing and the sambar, though promising, misses something. What can we say, competition is pretty tough out here and every person has a type, when it comes to sambar. The kitchen when visited was found to be hygienic and well kept. So for those of you finicky eaters out there, feel free to enjoy your food without wondering about where it came from.
