Among the workshops organized during the second half of day 1 - IGCLA 2016, ‘Core strengthening’ commenced at 2.15pm at the Futsal turf, Marena sports complex. The workshop was conducted by Dr. Fiddy Davis (Department of Exercise and Sports sciences, SOAHS) with the aid of his colleagues. The delegates were positively charged with energy and actively participated in the various activities hosted. As a part of sports medicine, this workshop’s aim was to stress on the importance of core muscles (abdominal/muscles of the trunk). Dr. Davis quoted that, “Proximal stability is required for distal mobility” emphasizing to strengthen the core muscles as it is involved in all movements of the human body.
