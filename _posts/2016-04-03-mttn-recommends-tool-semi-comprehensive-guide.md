<em><span style="color: #003300;">Throughout human history, as our species has faced the frightening,</span></em>
<em> <span style="color: #003300;"> terrorizing fact that we do not know who we are, or where we are going in</span></em>
<em> <span style="color: #003300;"> this ocean of chaos, it has been the authorities, the political, the</span></em>
<em> <span style="color: #003300;"> religious, the educational authorities who attempted to comfort us by</span></em>
<em> <span style="color: #003300;"> giving us order, rules, regulations, informing, forming in our minds their</span></em>
<em> <span style="color: #003300;"> view of reality. To think for yourself you must question authority and</span></em>
<em> <span style="color: #003300;"> learn how to put yourself in a state of vulnerable, open-mindedness;</span></em>
<em> <span style="color: #003300;"> chaotic, confused, vulnerability to inform yourself.</span></em>

<em><span style="color: #003300;">Think for yourself.</span></em>
<em> <span style="color: #003300;"> Question authority.”</span></em>

<span style="color: #003300;"><strong>Tool</strong> is a band whose music can only aptly be described as incredibly abstract and complex; something that’s become synonymous with the progressive rock/metal subgenre. What sets Tool apart is their innovation, art style; and the highly thematic and immensely metaphorical lyrical content.</span>

<span style="color: #003300;">As a lover of music and humanity in general, I consider it a moral responsibility to introduce to you the incredible gift to mankind that is Tool.</span>

<span style="color: #003300;">Tool consists of:</span>

<span style="color: #003300;"><em>Maynard James Keenan (vocals)</em></span>

<span style="color: #003300;"><em>Adam Jones (guitars, artwork)</em></span>

<span style="color: #003300;"><em>Justin Chancellor (bass)</em></span>

<span style="color: #003300;"><em>Danny Carey (drums, percussion)</em></span>

<a href="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Tool-band.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-1735"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1735" src="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Tool-band-1024x819.jpg" alt="Tool-band" width="658" height="526" /></a>

<span style="color: #003300;"><strong><em>Lateralus</em></strong>, often cited as their magnum opus, is about opening yourself up to new experiences and embracing the randomness and chaos all about us in life. The title track itself is one of the most beautiful and intricate pieces ever made in the history of music. Huddle up as I blow your mind to smithereens with Tool trivia.</span>

<span style="color: #003300;"><em>Lateralus</em>, the song, is most famous for the fact that the number of syllables in its verses follow the Fibonacci series. It starts with a slow riff played continuously that eventually builds up to an earth-shattering crescendo at about 1:36 in minutes and seconds. This, when converted to the decimal, becomes <em><strong>1 minute + 0.618ths</strong></em> of a minute. Fun fact: the Golden Ratio <strong>'phi</strong>', when rounded off to the fourth decimal becomes 1.618. This also ties it to the Fibonacci sequence as the ratio of one Fibonacci number to its predecessor tends towards the Golden Ratio!</span>

<span style="color: #003300;">The time signature of the chorus is 9/8, 8/8, 7/8. This may or may not be a coincidence (and knowing Adam Jones and Danny Carey’s love for math and sacred geometry, probably not), but the 16<sup>th</sup> number of the Fibonacci sequence is 987.</span>

<span style="color: #003300;">Let all of that sink in for a while. That’s just one song.</span>

<span style="color: #003300;">Another piece to exemplify their musical style would be <em>Right in Two</em>, off the album <em><strong>10,000 Days</strong></em>.</span>

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HBsZbL-Akms

<span style="color: #003300;"><em>Right in Two</em> is a 9-minute masterpiece that mostly follows a time signature of 11/8 with minor changes. It features a mandala solo played by Danny Carey. It speaks of humanity’s innate drive to cause mayhem and its inability to live in harmony without external supervision.</span>

<span style="color: #003300;">The album itself refers to the amount of time (27 years, approx. 10,000 days) Maynard James Keenan’s mother (Judith Marie) suffered from paralysis and was confined to a wheelchair until she finally breathed her last and “went home” (song: <em>10,000 days</em>). The song speaks of the utter injustice that a human being as exceptionally good as his mother had to go through 27 years of living hell. It also speaks of the hypocrites who came to mourn her loss despite not having cared for her while she was alive.</span>

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_2T43dy_Ew

<span style="color: #003300;">Maynard James Keenan has written about his mother and her suffering in two songs of this album (<em>Wings for Marie</em>, <em>10,000 days</em>) and ‘<em>Judith</em>’, in the album <em><strong>Mer De Noms</strong></em> by another one of his projects (<strong>A Perfect Circle</strong>) .</span>

&nbsp;

<span style="color: #003300;"><strong>Tool</strong> love experimenting with their sound, and go to great lengths in that pursuit. Danny Carey underwent training in tabla under Aloke Dutta and delved into traditional Indian music subsequently. Resultantly, their music sounds like a mystical plethora of confused sounds, blent into a singular piece of rich, vibrant, sophisticated and complex music coupled with genius levels of production.</span>

<span style="color: #003300;">Maynard and Adam’s writing in<strong> Tool’s</strong> songs is highly cathartic on a lyrical level. They speak of numerous issues in their albums and use highly metaphorical language. Their music has evolved in a rather poetic way over time. Their first album, <strong><em>Undertow</em></strong>, speaks of abuse ("<em>Prison Sex</em>") and toxic relationships ("<em>Sober</em>"). </span>

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hglVqACd1C8

<span style="color: #003300;">Their sophomore effort talks about change; a change from the darker <em><strong>Undertow</strong></em>. It is called <em><strong>Ænima</strong>,</em> a portmanteau of enema  (rectal evacuation) and the Jungian concept of Anima and Animus. It literally stands for 'soul enema'. In <strong><em>Ænima</em></strong> we find Maynard venting a lot of angst against modern society  (like in the title track based on Bill Hicks' comedy routine 'arising bay') and haranguing the hypocrisy and vacuity of the ‘LA Lifestyle’ and popular elements of American culture.</span>

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8vmaj75xzE

<span style="color: #003300;"> The song <em>Stinkfist</em> from the same album has lyrics that hint at sodomy on a superficial level in a very tongue-in-cheek way, but upon closer inspection, are actually about human connection.</span>

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F97RgIz_fTE

<span style="color: #003300;"><em>46&amp;2</em>, also from the same album is again thematically related to the Jungian school of thought, which hypothesizes that the human form will eventually reach a state in which the body would have 2 more than the normal 46 chromosomes, leaving it in an unbalanced, disharmonious and chaotic state.</span>

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tja6_h4lT6A

<span style="color: #003300;">This chaos is a recurring theme in most of <strong>Tool’s</strong> albums. They vouch for chaos being the natural order of life and this is reflected in their lyrics, their compositions (one word – polyrhythms) and their production (check out their song <em>Faaip de Oiad</em>. Then look me in the eye and tell me you’re NOT creeped out.)</span>

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqO3BByBflg

<span style="color: #003300;">The art style and lyrical content aside, another reason <strong>Tool</strong> is so highly revered amongst the Progressive music community is because of their virtuosic, highly intricate and complex compositions. The song <em>Schism</em> from Lateralus, for instance, alters its meter a staggering 47 times!</span>

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0jH96EFkw4

<span style="color: #003300;"> The droning and dominant 5/8, 7/8 basslines (courtesy of Justin Chancellor) make this hard to spot, so you’ll need to have a really trained ear in music to be able to notice it without prior knowledge of this fact (unlike <strong>Dream Theater’s</strong> <em>Dance of Eternity</em>, in which they’re not even <em>trying</em> to be remotely subtle about the 130 + time signatures in the song!).</span>

<span style="color: #003300;">Schism is an interesting piece of music lyrically because it speaks of the dangers of silence,ignorance and believing in a controlled,deterministic outlook. The polyrythms symbolically represent the unrelenting chaos that surrounds us. </span>

To add to that,<strong> Tool</strong> gave us <em>Parabol/Parabola</em> from <em><strong>Lateralus</strong></em>. One of the most life-affirming songs ever written, this talks about how everything is linked on a molecular level. The same molecules that scattered across the milky way after the big bang are the molecules constituting us. This means we are essentially <em>eternal</em> because matter cannot be destroyed but only <em>transformed</em>. And in this view , all pain and negativity is but an illusion  of our psyche. It talks about being alive in this moment and being one with this reality.

&nbsp;

<span style="color: #003300;">All of this barely scratches the surface of the sheer musical genius of Tool, but it should give you a fair idea of who they are and the kind of music they make. Every fan of Tool is an artist in their own way; it takes a certain level of musical understanding and artistic vision to truly comprehend the extent of their brilliance. Definitely give it a shot. It might just be the inspiration you need to pick up an instrument (or an advanced mathematics textbook), or get better at yours.</span>

<span style="color: #003300;">To conclude it all, here’s Danny Carey playing the outro to Lateralus.</span>

<span style="color: #003300;">Goosebumps. Every single time.</span>
