The annual national level inter-college forensics quiz conducted by the Department of Forensic Medicine, KMC Manipal marked the start of IGCLA 2016. The day long quiz saw participants from various colleges engaging in a battle to prove themselves the best.

The opening ceremony began with lighting of the lamp, after which Dr. Vinod Nayak, the head of department, spoke about the quiz. This was followed by an invocation, after which Dr. H S Ballal, the pro-chancellor expressed his joy at the successful organisation of the event. He then proceeded to inaugurate the newly formed student forensic society, <em>Justitia.</em> The Dean also addressed the audience present, after which the event T-shirt was released. The ceremony ended with a vote of thanks by Dr. Anitha.

The quiz itself was divided into five semifinal rounds. The winning team from each round entered the finals. The runners up participated in a wild card entry round for a second chance at getting into the final. What made it more interesting was the unique names given to the rounds like Examination in Chief, Cross examination etc.

The finals saw neck to neck competition between the six winning teams. There were six rounds in the finals, after which the winners were:

First: Aditya Rameshwaran &amp; Jishnu Nair (Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences, Kochi)

Second: Kavya &amp; Akhil (AJ Institute of Medical Sciences, Mangalore)

Third: Dhara Varun &amp; Leena S (Meenakshi Medical College, Kanchipuram)
