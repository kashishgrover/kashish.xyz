<em>“Peace cannot be kept by force; it can only be achieved by understanding.”</em>

<em>                                                                                                                     -Albert Einstein.</em>

&nbsp;

The world, at the present moment, is engulfed in all sorts of vices, blood-shed, wars, poverty and hostilities. A person now finds the internet plagued with videos of bombings, terrorist attacks, atrocities in the Middle East, and much more. Apart from these problems on the anthropological level, the world is observing large scale devastation of the much needed flora and fauna as well, in the name of “society advancement”.

At a time of such immense and excruciating global unrest, the world is crying out loud for new, effectual, diplomatic, and dynamic leaders, who shall relieve the world of this tumult, through smart and economically viable decisions. The world is on the lookout for “Leaders of Tomorrow”.

Holding testimony to this need, Leaders of Tomorrow, MIT, Manipal, hosted the opening ceremony of “Summit Manipal MMXVI”. Being held from March 17-20, 2016, this MUN will be one of a kind. This year, the number of delegates has soared to an incredible 250+ count from 40 different colleges. The paramount objective of this MUN is to inculcate leadership skills among the youth, and thereby incubate the making of world class leaders in the near future. This venture aims at helping students indulge in meaningful conversations about the contemporary issues that the world is facing at the moment, and present an efficient solution for the same. “Nolite Malum”, which translates as “Negate Evil”, is the motto of each Summit Manipal, and that’s what it’s aimed at achieving.

In India’s oldest college MUN, students from 7 diverse committees (such as WHO, NATO, UNSC, etc.), and many countries will together find out and highlight the best course of action in a disastrous and chaotic world. Problems such as widespread epidemics, Syrian refugee crisis, drug trafficking and lack of press freedom shall be some of the major topics of discussion. In the opening ceremony, the names of the committees were revealed along with their respective chairpersons and vice chairpersons. The chief guest for the night was Maitrey Mishra, who explained and encouraged the true essence of this MUN. She made the MUNers realize their true objective and potential. She urges students to use this platform in its entire sanctity, to look beyond boundaries, and become aware of the current global scenario, and in the process, do something to smoothen it out.

Leaders of Tomorrow took this opportunity to promote UN’s “He for She” campaign, in this summit. This campaign targets to achieve gender equality in all parts of the world. Certain issues regarding gender discrimination are part of the General Speaker’s List (GSL).

From 6 pm onwards, NLH becomes the pseudo UN headquarters, wherein students who roleplay as delegates, will be voicing out their opinions regarding the issues enveloping the globe.

Ambitious? Perhaps.

Epic? Definitely!
