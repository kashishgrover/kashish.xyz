Manipal – O – Pedia, the event organized by The Think Tank, saw the students of MIT interacting with a bunch of eclectic speakers who invigorated and inspired them to break the monotony in their college lifestyle and step into the not-so-small, seemingly invisible world around campus. The event was seen as a catalyst for the student community of Manipal to transcend personal and social barriers, create opportunities for themselves that inspire passion, encourage the spirit of adventure, and most of all, take the very necessary leap of faith. Manipal – O – Pedia incorporated talks from five speakers from an array of fields, as diverse as surfing, bird-watching, photography, and expedition cycling. Here’s a gist of the words that inspired scores of young minds.

<a href="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/13000196_1201642816513628_4162864665164284228_n.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-2299"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2299" src="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/13000196_1201642816513628_4162864665164284228_n.jpg" alt="13000196_1201642816513628_4162864665164284228_n" width="824" height="549" /></a>

The very first speaker, Ganesh Nayak, our own faculty member delivered what was one of the most awe-inspiring stories that many had heard in Manipal so far. An alumnus of MIT, Ganesh Nayak went from being a full time smoker to a full time expedition cyclist. His journey, as he likes to put it, was one full of adversaries, trials and tribulations, as well as an immense amount of dedication and hard work.

“I had tried quitting many times, but it just didn’t work out. I realized that I had to change my attitude, and my lifestyle completely. Out of all the things, I picked up a bicycle. Why? I don’t know. But the first time I tried to ride it, I could go only fifty meters.”

He has travelled from Srinagar to Manipal via Nepal, all on his bicycle. He reminisced on how his journey took him through mountains, deserts, and over frozen rivers.  He remarked on how his mother would ask him why he was going through so much trouble just to get from
one place to the other. “This is when I realized, that it’s really tough being a dreamer”. Join Ganesh sir’s cycling expeditions on weekends to get to know more about Manipal.

The mood for travel already being set, Dikshit Sharma, a third year student of MIT, was welcomed far too keenly by the ever – intrigued crowd. He began with his story of ‘Life on the Road’, a journey whose sheer exuberance was brought out by breathtaking pictures paralleled with lively music. Dikshit spoke about his travels across a plethora of subcontinents, reminiscing on how he jammed with absolute
strangers during the course of one of his travels in China, and that experience, till date, remains one of his most memorable moments. Shifting from his travel logs, Dikshit Sharma gave an account of his travels around Manipal; be it catching the sunrise at Kundadri hills, or wading through the water at Murudeshwar.

Traveling having been covered rather quite extensively, Tushar and Ishita, founders of The Shaka Surf Club, shifted the entire mood of the event. The sheer energy and gusto with which they remarked on the trials and tribulations of going against stereotypical mindsets to set up a surf school, moved the entire crowd of AC Seminar Hall. The Shaka Surf Club is all about freedom in the waves, good vibes, not taking things too seriously and learning to just go with the flow. The word ‘Shaka’ literally means "hang loose" or "take it easy." Founded in 2007, the Shaka Surf Club is one of the first surf schools in India. It was started with the ideology to share Tushar and Ishita’s passion for surfing, with all the good folk who crossed their wave-filled path. The Shaka Surf Club provides beginner level surf lessons, surfboard rentals and accommodation at their Surf Camp along Malpe Beach. People of all ages are welcome to come and surf!

The next speaker  was Ramit Singhal. He remembered on how he had wanted to become an environmentalist in the tenth grade, but ended up taking up math and science, because apparently, if you’ve done science, you can do everything. The sheer expanse of flora and fauna
in and around Manipal is something that initially attracted Ramit Sir to come to here in the first place. As he worked his way through being selected for an internship at National Geographic, and publishing papers, he realized the beauty of the fauna that we miss by sitting in our rooms, and not stepping out. The informally established, ‘Manipal Birders Club’ is open to joining for students and teachers alike. If being out in the wild, spotting birds, is your forte, come aboard and join this club to see the wonders of Manipal.

The entire event being so motivational and informative, the end address by Rahul Narlanka, another professor from MIT, was the ideal talk to culminate Manipal – O – Pedia. Instead of focusing on actually going out in the wild to spot different birds, Rahul Sir told the crowd the secret of coming across a Spotted Owl behind IC, or even the Indian Paradise Flycatcher outside the main gate! He remarked on how the number of birds in Manipal actually exceeds that of a National Park! Through his college stories, he explained the art of getting into photography, and actually developing it into a serious hobby. Experts and rookies alike were rather interested with his talk. Catch up with him in his cabin, and he’ll happily tell you about his ‘Forays into (terrible) architectural photography’, as he would like to put it.

When it comes to enjoying outside campus, we often sit and ponder about the places we can go and enjoy. Many of us sit in our rooms, sleep, and eat; and that’s how we spend our entire semester’s free days. There is more to Manipal than just college. And no, it’s not just the beaches or the lounges. It’s something more exhilarating, enthralling thatwill definitely leave you amazed. Now’s the time you stop being lazy, and actually realize the avenues of the place around you.
