They say, we should surround ourselves with people who will only lift us higher. In the words of Scott Adams, you don’t have to be a ‘person of influence’ to be influential; in fact, the most influential people in our lives are probably not even aware of all the things they have taught us. The <em>Association internationale des étudiants en sciences économiques et commerciales</em> (AIESEC), or the International Association of Students in Economic and Commercial Sciences, strongly believes in this, evident from its annually hosted event, Global Village.

Held on the 21st of August this year, at TMA Pai Hall, from 4 PM, this event captured a lot of interest from students. It involved interaction and team work among exchange students from different nations. The event started off with AIESECers jiving energetically to a number of tracks, and a PowerPoint presentation outlining what AIESEC is essentially about. Following this was a very interesting activity aimed at striking a chord among different people. The exchange students from different nations were made to form two concentric circles, facing each other, while moving counter-clockwise when the said tune was played. When the tune was stopped, they had to stop where they were and those standing opposite each other, face-to-face, had to interact with each other.

Adding to the agenda of events, ADA performed their prize-winning play which was lauded overwhelmingly by the audience, followed by some more jive. After that, the audience was in for an engrossing session where exchange students from AIESEC Manipal related their experiences abroad. An extraordinary performance by Showstoppers made the audience roar up in exhilaration, in line with a spell-binding show by Glam-n-Glitz depicting dance forms of the world, which rendered everyone speechless.

It was a really nice sight to see people interacting with exchange students from Egypt, USA, Iran, among others, and the smooth blending of cultures. From getting to know each other to taking selfies with each other, everyone was having a very good time.

The AIESEC Organising Committee had left no stone unturned to make the event successful. Be it the beautifully decorated cups reading ‘Global Village 2016’ which lined the stairway up to the hall, the huge flags of different nations in the hall, or the ‘colour’ all around, the OC had made sure that the event was a feast to the eye too.

“Through this event, we make people aware about the exchange program and give them an opportunity to interact with people who are already experiencing it. We expect a good turnout and a lot of people taking up the opportunity to go on an exchange”, says Yashvi Tekriwal, President of the Organising Committee of Global Village, 2016.

The event ended with AIESEC members briefing the audience on the purpose and the importance of AIESEC, and how to become a part of the same. An event which is one of its kind, it was a very interesting and, at the same time, productive evening for anyone and everyone who chose to be a part of it.
