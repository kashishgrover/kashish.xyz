Since its inception at the previous instalment of this very event, the Student Research Forum has gone from strength to strength. Mr. Arup Saha represented the student body in a talk aimed at promoting intercollegiate collaborations in the various facets involved in research.

He further discussed the various activities taken up by the KMC edition of SRF as well as the need for research, especially of an interdisciplinary nature. He briefly touched upon the various steps undertaken as part of a research project, urging all who were interested to take up the call.
