The blissful feeling you get after handing in your last paper of the end semester exams tags along with you on the journey home. It lingers as you wake up late in the mornings and abuse your PlayStation. Then results arrive and the feeling is violently killed because you've failed an exam or two and now have to travel <em>back </em>to Manipal - a place you weren't hoping to see quite so soon. Make up exams. Few other combinations of words can sound so dreadful.

Well, now that you've accepted your fate, cancelled your old tickets and booked your new ones, you need to register for the subjects you gave an F (grade) about.

There are three practical ways you can go about registering for make ups.
<blockquote>Method one:</blockquote>
&nbsp;

This method requires that you have a friend in Manipal/Udupi who either owes you one or is willing to do you a favour. Call them up, ask them to fill out the form for you and pay the required amount, by a challan from ICICI bank, at the academic section. Then promise to pay your friend back later, though you don’t really have to follow through on this.
<blockquote>Method two:</blockquote>
&nbsp;

Recent events have caused the college to put on their Captain McSwagger pants and change to a fully online-based payment model. So the method to pay by DD will slowly be discontinued (they don't want the DD no more). I've still included the method below in case anyone needs it, but the current most 'hip' and 'fly' way to do it is to go to https://sis.manipal.edu/studlogin.aspx (keep in mind, this is only for studs), enter your details to login and select Fee Kart on the left-hand column. Follow the instructions there to pay by debit/credit card and attach the receipt along with your application when you send it in.

Here's the old DD method:

This is the most boring method of the lot, but it <del>is</del> was also the official way to do it. Download the makeup form <a href="http://websismit.manipal.edu/images/docs/ExamApplications.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>, take a printout and fill it up. You then need to get a <strong>demand draft</strong> (DD) made addressed to<strong> ‘MANIPAL UNIVERSITY. Manipal’ payable at Manipal</strong>. It’s 550 rupees per subject (UG) a d 850 rupees per subject (PG). Scan both of these documents (or take photos of them) and email them to <strong>academic.section@manipal.edu</strong> after which you should post these documents to the following address:
<blockquote>The Academic Section
MIT, Manipal
Karnataka 576104</blockquote>
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The advantage of doing it this way is that your hall-ticket is ready by the time you reach Manipal, which might not be the case if you decide to go with
<blockquote>Method three:</blockquote>
&nbsp;

This isn’t really a proper method, but you can actually register in person after you land in Manipal. Of course, you will have crossed the last date to apply for make ups (which is the <strong>18th of June</strong>) but you can try and convince them to let you register anyway. Everything else is the same. Fill out the form, get a challan from ICICI and submit the documents at the academic section. We only recommend doing this if you’re reading this after June 18th, <strong>if you live outside of the country</strong> or if you’re feeling particularly lazy. Do drop them an email ahead of time if you're planning on doing this.

For Paper Seeing and Revaluation (exclusively for F grade students) here's the procedure-

Download the application form <a href="http://websismit.manipal.edu/images/docs/Re-Valuations_Application.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>. Fill it out, scan it, and send it to the above-mentioned email address(refer to Method two) with the proof of payment. The payment can be made in the following ways-
<ol>
 	<li>Through the University Website: https://sis.manipal.edu/studlogin.aspx</li>
 	<li>Through the State Bank of India's State Bank Collect Facility: www.onlinesbi.com&gt;State Bank Collect&gt;Karnataka&gt;Education Institutions&gt;Manipal University</li>
 	<li>By Demand Draft: In favour of "Manipal University" payable at Udupi/Manipal(with your name and registration number at the back side of your DD); post it to the above-mentioned address (again, refer to Method Two).</li>
</ol>
The amount to be paid for this procedure is 750 Rupees per subject and the last date is <strong>3rd June. </strong>Paper seeing will be held on the <strong>7th of June</strong> and the Revaluation Results will be out on the <strong>11th of June.</strong>

&nbsp;

Remember, <strong>the last date to apply for makeups</strong> by the first two methods is the <strong>18th of June</strong>. So unless you’re a daring and rebellious individual, send in your forms and blackmail your friends before then.

All the best, guys.
