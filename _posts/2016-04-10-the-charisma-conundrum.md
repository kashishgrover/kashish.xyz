There are many people in this world, both real and fictional who exude a different, majestic aura of their own. They emit a plethora of charming vibes around them, and seem something straight out of a personality enhancement guide, and you always aspire to incorporate some of their traits to increase your coolness quotient.

The Psych Club organized “The Charisma Conundrum” to teach the art of personal magnetism and attaining a heightened sense of confidence. Now the words might seem blown out of proportion, but this is exactly what the workshop catered to. “Charisma” is defined as the ability to charm people around you, merely by your presence and speech, and be a memorable character in everyone’s heart. One needs to be charismatic in order to stand out from the crowd, be influential, hold power, and at the same time, be loved by everyone around. The workshop explained the science behind charisma enhancement, running through the fundamentals, which primarily consist of the following golden mantra:
<blockquote>Presence. Power. Warmth</blockquote>
These traits are acquired when a person imbibes the perfect amalgamation of body language, eye contact, diction, and positivity. Some people already have the inbuilt circuitry to this elixir of life, but the majority lacks it. The presentation aimed on explaining tips to the students, such as “How an always smiling guy becomes adorable”, “One should not fake body language, but instead try to be comfortable in their own skin”, “What one’s mind believes, his/her body manifests”, and many more such useful life hacks. The presentation iterated the need for a human being to be reminiscing about his/her positive aspects over and over again, as this creates a deep and significant impact. Moreover other important aspects such as vocal tonality and confidence enhancement were discussed in brief, and the students were provided with valuable inputs on the same.
