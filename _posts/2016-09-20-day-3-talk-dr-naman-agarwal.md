The third day of the hitherto successful conference was kick-started by the much awaited session by Dr. Naman Agrawal. His maiden lecture, in IGCLA 2015, opened emergency medicine as a highly demanding and challenging option for specialization to undergraduates. This year, he delivered an important lesson to all those interested in choosing this specialty later on – “the golden hour of emergency medicine”. He emphasized that every second is crucial in the Emergency Department and that each decision the attending makes, can decide life or death for the patient. His highly interactive session reminded all the medical graduates of the enormity of the responsibilities they’ll have to shoulder as doctors.
