The students in college are broadly divided into three non-exclusive sets. The first set includes those people who try to eat regularly from the Food Court, or one of the messes they've diligently subscribed to, the second set of people are the ones who're halfway into the first and halfway into the third: eat from the messes they're a part of but more often than not you will see them tagging along with their friends because they are tired of the boring <em>rasam</em> and<em> rajma; </em>and the third set of people like to call themselves 'freelancers'. They eat out all the time, and though they proudly claim they're saving a lot of money and managing to eat good food as well, they know deep down that it would be good to have the mess as a fall back option.

Here's the thing: whether you belong to the first, second or the third set- what seems inevitable is giving in to the eateries on campus. They're the beautiful souls you can reach out to without parting for auto money, and they're moderately cheaper than most restaurants you'd frequent. Add to that the promise that you can choose the cuisine of your interest. Here is a list for the delighted fresher who needs to know where to grab a quick bite before lab, that burger place everyone's been praising, or where to go instead when you're broke.
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>K.C Canteen</strong></span><em> </em></li>
</ul>
This is literally the first eating place that meets your eyes when you enter campus. It comes across as a good college hangout place, albeit small and extremely full during peak hours. However, after having spent a considerable amount of time there, you come to realize that they treat you with a lot of affection. The food in the place is simple and thoroughly filling for 80 rupees. They offer breakfast, lunch and dinner.

<strong>MTTN Recommends</strong>: Cheese Omelette and toast, Anda Bhurji Parota, Parota Korma, Chef’s special Cheese chicken. For Vegetarians Paneer Butter Masala is one exotic choice. The lime juice is a must have, though one of the more famous beverages is the Sipra.
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Snack point</strong></span></li>
</ul>
The In-campus of the Tiger Circle Snack Shack Franchise, Snack Point stands by its name at providing  <em>fast </em>food. Hungry at an odd hour, with no particular plan in mind, Snack Point could be your answer. Across from the KC canteen, they are the makers of one of the best burgers around. The Jack-Shack burger is a specialty for meat lovers. The lesser known Shack-special burger, although costs a mere 15 rupees more, is phenomenally better in terms of the sausages and salami. The cinnamon iced tea, and the mint lime is the best utilization of 30 bucks on campus, especially in the even semester when the crazy heat kicks in.

<strong>MTTN Recommends:</strong> Chutney Mary is a steal for 50 rupees, and is hands down the most enjoyable veg burger you can find around town. One other thing to try out would be the Potato lovers (Although we’d recommend you share it with someone, the flavor is too overwhelming to have by yourself). For Non-Vegetarians- Jack Shack Burger or the Shack Special.
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Sindhi Mess</strong></span></li>
</ul>
So, this place is not exactly on ‘campus’, but it’s within the gates. It’s serves north-Indian (ish) food, run by a family that lives upstairs from the place you eat at. They're one of the few people who care if you've eaten. You can enroll yourself on a monthly basis, or visit when you're particularly missing home food. Eat all you can for a 75 rupees Veg Meal, and 90 rupees for Nonveg. Their lime juice is to kill for, and the food is scrumptious and filling.

<strong>MTTN Recommends: </strong>While we recommend you try the meals there, there are other things to order as well like the aloo jeera. The lassi is amazing too. While you're there, don't forget to say Hi to their enormous dog who's going to be right around to welcome you.
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Rajasthani Mess: </strong></span></li>
</ul>
Neighbors to Sindhi mess, it’s a relatively new place. With their shiny plates, this place serves only vegetarian food. Their Daal-baati-Churma available on Wednesdays and Fridays is majorly popular. Owing to competition, their rates are the same as Sindhi, and for all Gujarati food lovers, the dal is lovely (not sweet, though). That said, it would be a bit of a stretch to expect the food there to actually taste like Rajasthani cuisine.

<strong>MTTN Recommends: </strong>Have their meals for your money's worth.
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Campus Grill </strong></span></li>
</ul>
This food establishment sits right behind the nineteenth block and caters to the late night food cravings of the 16<sup>th</sup>, 17th, 18th, 19th and 20<sup>th</sup> blocks belting out a wide variety of dishes that fit a shoestring budget. This canteen remains open for longer than any other taking orders as late as one during the end semester exams. If you are looking for a "value for money" meal then the Chinese combo and the Indian combo offer a filling spread like Chilli chicken, Chicken fried rice, Chicken 65 and a range of milkshakes at the economical price of 200. They also offer many shawarma related dishes all of which are conveniently priced under 80 to suit the cash strapped and perpetually hungry Manipal teen. The only downside here is that the food tends to be a bit oily and the delivery tends to get delayed.

<strong>MTTN Recommends: </strong>Among other must haves are the chicken lollipop and potato lovers. The noodles, when paired with the chicken gravy, is also a yummy choice.
<ul>
 	<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">15th Block Canteen</span>:</strong></li>
</ul>
Satiating the ravenous appetites of the 14<sup>th</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup> blocks, this canteen serves virtually most things one could ask for. They have noodles, pasta and the rice. They also offer a wide variety of culturally inaccurate and ethnically offending Chinese food that are perfect for snacking on when burning the midnight oil. This place provides an array of lip smacking meals at prices that shall assuredly not result in your filing for bankruptcy.

<strong>MTTN Recommends: </strong>The Schezwan rice, in particular, is tangy to the tongue and merciful to the wallet, and is thus highly recommended. Another hallmark of this humble joint is the Packet Kulfi which is just the thing to nervously binge on when you have assignments piling up (*wink,wink*).
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Cafeteria: </strong></span></li>
</ul>
There will be times when you miss breakfast, or do not have enough time to go back and have your lunch and it is then that you should take a visit to the famed MIT Cafeteria. Cheap and filling food is aplenty here. The breakfast fare is quite varied, you can have the dosas, the sandwiches and if you’re adventurous enough, the pastas and pizzas. Do try the idli and upma for being pocket friendly and filling, and the sandwiches when you’re flush with money. For lunch, you can have the North Indian meal if you are one of those people who likes unlimited food, and if you’re feeling exceptionally generous, you can have the paneer tikka masala and butter naans.  The chaat stall is a good option if you want tasty, buttery pav-bhaji or spicy bhel puri. You can wash it all down with juices and milkshakes from the attached juice centre.

<strong>MTTN Recommends: </strong>The chole bhature and paneer kulcha are worth a try. The Oreo shake, Mango shake and the Mousambi juice are highly recommended, and fresh Orange juice should not be missed either. Among the Dosas- Mysore Masala Dosa and Paper Dosa account for the best. Also try Paneer Cheese Paratha/ Cheese Paratha when you're bored of the Dosas.
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>10th block Canteen: </strong></span></li>
</ul>
It is an amazing place for when you get those midnight munchies. You get good food for cheap, and they deliver to your blocks. What better, eh? The egg fried rice and the veg macaroni are very filling, but if you’re more of a health nut, you can order boiled eggs or egg sandwiches (#GymBoyForLife). They even sell Rasna in case you feel nostalgic about your childhood. However, they do not deliver after 1, and the fried rice sometimes gets over around 1230. You’ve been warned.

<strong>MTTN Recommends:  </strong>Cheese Maggi and chicken club sandwiches should be ordered when you’re in dire need of some soul food.
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Apoorva: </strong></span></li>
</ul>
A small pseudo-restaurant on the way to the 14<sup>th</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup> block, this place satisfies hungers at 12 am, and brings you proper meals to your hostel door. A perfect exam time solution, Apoorva has a wide variety of dishes to choose from. Most things to eat here taste great for their cost, the 10 rupee sherbet in a variety of flavours is definitely a steal. This is one of the few places on campus where you get Chaat and Panipuris.

<strong>MTTN Recommends: </strong>The Chicken parota is worth a try for non vegetarians. The Paneer Biryani makes for a good meal on a hungry and poor night. Dal Khichdi for 75 bucks is also a great option though it becomes bland after a little while.
<ul>
 	<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Other Block Canteens:</strong></span></li>
</ul>
These are all canteens managed by ‘Chef on Wheels’, the catering agency to whom all the college-supplied food has been outsourced to. These canteens are in the 14<sup>th</sup>, 15<sup>th</sup>, 16<sup>th</sup>, 17<sup>th</sup>, 9<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> blocks. These canteens offer generically the same thing: puffs, packeted wafers, frooti and the lot. They are good places for a very small snack as they tend to be very reasonable. 20 bucks for a chicken puff that you will not stop eating. And a decent machine cardamom tea for all the chai lovers out there (Trust me, this is your best bet on campus). These night canteens serve food from 6pm to 12 am, while the library canteen is open from 10 am to 5 pm.

Food in Manipal is easily found, and even better enjoyed with a smile and good company. Eating in campus may not be very adventurous, but it is rewarding, and with a full belly, all good things will undoubtedly come your way.
