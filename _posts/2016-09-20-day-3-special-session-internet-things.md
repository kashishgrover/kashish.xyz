The term, Internet of Things, was coined by Kevin Ashton in the year 1999. Since then, this term has developed and evolved alongside technology.

Last defined in 2008, the Internet of Things has come to describe a number of technologies and research disciplines that enable the Internet to reach out into the real world of physical objects.

It is a complex concept in its entirety. However, Dr. Syam Sundar, Senior Project Manager at IBM, presented the same in a fabulous presentation. He broke down the broad concept into smaller segments to facilitate efficient understanding of the topic. The presentation was made with the students in mind as the examples he used were especially relatable.

Dr. Syam Sundar kept the entire session alive by interacting with the students frequently. He managed to dazzle the students with the magic of IoT and make this special session of IGCLA, Day 3 a memorable one.
