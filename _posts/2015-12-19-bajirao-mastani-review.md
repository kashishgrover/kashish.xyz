    Amazing sets, slightly overbearing
    soundtrack, incredibly talented cast but
    the lack of a solid plot leads to a
    slight disappointment when you can
    clearly see the potential. Still, a
    guaranteed treat to the eyes.

December 18, a tough decision was to be made. See the King of Bollywood with his favourite on-screen female counterpart (and ours too) or go for an epic with an impressive cast and expectations of a sizzling chemistry.

I chose the latter, because someone spoiled Dilwale for me. And I'm glad they did, it was terrible.

Anyhow. Bajirao Mastani. Or as I like to call if, Ata Baji Satakli.

The Maratha court is in session. A new Peshwa is needed to guide the forces to the heart of Mughal rule: Delhi. In strides Ranveer Singh as Bajirao and this is basically what happens: he sweeps the court off their feet with one trick shot, and draws a parallel with a done-to-death military strategy. Instant promotion. Much amaze. Such skill. Wow.

In all honesty, Singh doesn't just look like Bajirao, he <em>feels</em> like Bajirao. That is great because it's tough to imagine someone in that role and the way he does justice to it is beautiful.

The first truly positive impression, however, is left by the set. One word: grandiose. Trust Sanjay Leela Bhansali to go all out on elaborate design.

EnterÂ Priyanka Chopra as Kashibai, Bajirao's first wife and a bit naive, so to speak. She thinks the world of her husband, and somehow through the wonder of optics, has him in her sights from far away just because LOOKATHIMHE'SHOOOOOOOT;

And then cometh Deepika Padukone, as a pretty respectable Mastani. Half Rajput, half Muslim. Full badass. She's the kind of woman who dances, both on the battlefield and off it with equal grace and skill. She saves his life, he saves hers. Needless to say, both of them go gaga. She marries him (his knife technically. Long story.) and moves into his life where she's never really accepted because a) She's Muslim and b) She's Bajirao's second wife.

&nbsp;

Slowly, we meet the family: A widowed mother satisfied with the status quo, a brother who slowly shifts to the dark side as the story progresses, the head priest who's disgusted by the very existence of Mastani and a minister who never liked Bajirao anyway. Also, later in the film you'll see that Kashi's son becomes a pseudo villain right around the time he hits puberty. Talk about rebellious teenagers.

And that's just about where the development stops. A love triangle. Everything from this point onwards is a cause-and-effect scenario revolving around Bajirao the braveheart, Kashi the first wife who wishes she wasn't, and Mastani who acts as a soulmate.

And of course, the lavish setting that this entire epic takes place in.

The story exists, which is good news. Nothing phenomenal and definitely not something a historian would happily approve of, but at least the film knows the direction it's supposed to follow. Visually, it's magical. It's like the knob was set to 10 and taped there, because even murky dark dungeons look breathtaking. The dialogue is powerful at some points and averagish at other. Also, if people getting wet (literally) is something you like...oh dear. Ranveer Singh likes water. So. Much.

If you're looking for something to treat your eyes to and like to keep your grey cells intact without worrying too much about a thrilling story, give it a shot. This movie has the potential to be an amazing historical without being historically accurate.
