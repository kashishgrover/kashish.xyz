‘Educate, Inspire, Connect’ - quoted by the first key-note lecturer of IGCLA 2016, Dr. M.G. Deo, (Padmashree awardee), Vice-President of Moving Academy of Medicine and Biomedicine. The academy, led by Dr. Deo, conducts various science workshops and contests for the school-going children from all socio-economic classes.
