<blockquote>It only pays to be prepared!</blockquote>
&nbsp;

Hello there, Freshers! Excited for your first year in college – for your new life, aren’t you? Well, when there’s so much activity packed for you, so many events and experiences to come your way, it’s only natural to be excited. With two huge college fests (viz. the tech-fest, <strong>TechTatva</strong> in October, and the cultural fest, <strong>Revels</strong> in March) in line with the University fest, <strong>Utsav</strong> in April, along with numerous other events spanning the whole year, it doesn't take much to figure how much of a thrill your year is going to be.

But, as easy as it is to lose yourself amidst all the fun, it is even more important to not let exactly that happen. It isn’t all that difficult. A bit of regularity coupled with sincerity will steer you through the year with a decent grade; add to that some more diligence, and there you are, an 8.5+ pointer – says a student who was fervently irregular to the point of almost regretting it later!

&nbsp;

It isn’t that bad an idea to be prepared in advance, is it?

One way is to be acquainted with the First Year curriculum.

The First Year, divided into 2 semesters, is also divided into 2 cycles – the Physics cycle and the Chemistry cycle. The system works on the 10-point credit based system. As goes without saying, higher the credits for a particular subject, greater its weightage on the grade point.

&nbsp;

<em>First things first – know your <strong>subjects!</strong></em>

Following is a list of subjects in each cycle, along with the respective credits:

<em> </em>

The first thing in an Engineering college is, there is no next time!

<em>‘It’s just that I didn’t study this time, I’ll do better next time, for sure!’ </em>

Convince yourself all you like, the ‘next time’ never comes…well, mostly. No, not scaring you, just making you aware!

<em>Take your <strong>tests &amp; assignments </strong>seriously, from the very start!</em>
<ul>
 	<li>Each subject, of 3 and 4 credits, is evaluated out of 100 – 50 in the internals, and 50 in the End-Semester Examination.</li>
 	<li>The Internal Assessment consists of 5 assignments, of 4 marks each, and 2 Sessional Tests, of 15 marks each. The remaining 50 marks are covered in the End-Semester Examination paper.</li>
 	<li>For the 1 credit subjects, there are 12 Lab classes, each evaluated on 10. The total out of 120 is proportionately reduced to its equivalent out of 60. The End-Semester Examination is conducted out of 40, thus totaling to 100.</li>
 	<li>Only Workshop Practice has no End-Semester Examinations. Evaluation is done based on 12 classes (4 Electrical, 4 Mechanical and 4 Civil) and the viva conducted after each set of 4 classes.</li>
</ul>
<u>PERSONAL TIP: DO NOT NEGLECT THE ASSIGNMENTS WHICH MAY APPEAR TO BE OF 4 MARKS ONLY. THAT IS EXACTLY WHERE YOU CAN UP YOUR SCORE!</u>

<em>You absolutely do not want to come back for an <strong>Improvement Examination!</strong></em>
<ul>
 	<li>In case of F grade in any of the subjects, the student is allowed to take the exam in the Improvement Examinations (Make-up Examinations).</li>
 	<li>The maximum grade awarded in the Make-up exams, however, is C.</li>
 	<li>If a student gets F grade in the Make-up Examination, he/she is required to repeat the subject by re-registering for the same in the next even semester.</li>
</ul>
<strong><em>Bunking </em></strong><em>– Too cool, eh?</em>

<em> </em>College seems almost synonymous to bunking, isn’t it? Be careful, though. You are required to have an attendance of 75%, unless, of course, you want to repeat the subject without even being allowed to take the exam! (Oh and yes, you need to attend the classes with a different batch all over again, and all your Internal Assessment marks are zero-fied!)

<strong> </strong><em>Towards Second Year<strong>…</strong></em>

<strong><em> </em></strong>Students are required to earn a minimum of 25 credits to get promoted to Second Year. For each subject you pass, you earn the corresponding number of credits.

<em>Want to <strong>change your branch</strong>?</em>

It is possible, but depends on whether your Grade Point at the end of the year is higher than the minimum required to shift to a particular branch and largely on the seat availability.

Well, that pretty much sums the academic curriculum of First Year. It isn’t difficult, really. Just devote the right amount of time – not too much, just right – for your studies (assignments, specially!) amidst all the activities.

All the best!
