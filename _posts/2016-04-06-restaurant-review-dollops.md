<strong style="line-height: 1.5;"><em>The experience:</em></strong>

Dollops, once a movie hall and then an ice cream parlor, is now an iconic restaurant, serving Indian as well as Chinese, located right at the heart of Manipal. Exposed stone walls hung with posters of Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Jimmy Hendrix and Bob Marley, a skylight allowing natural light to filter in and some really nice music provides a lovely shack-like ambience to the place.

On our visit, the food looked and smelled mouth-watering and turned out to be equally tasty, but could use a little less oil. Presentation of the food was very basic with no fancy touches at all. Service was prompt and waiters, though very busy, were helpful when asked for suggestions. A tour of their orderly kitchen also assured us that the food is prepared in hygienic conditions.

The menu, though substantial in both Chinese and Indian dishes, is highly unimaginative and has nothing every other Indian or Chinese place does not serve. Their Chicken Lollipop is a dish one must try. Be ready for a wait if visiting on a Saturday night or Sunday afternoon.
