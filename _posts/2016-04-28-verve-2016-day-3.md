It was the third day of one of the most awaited fests of KMC, Verve 2016. With emotions running high and overwhelming enthusiasm, the events were as follows:
<ul>COLLAGE:</ul>
Something that is uncertain or whose influence is unpredictable is always named ‘the game changer’. Such was the theme of the collage making contest: Wildcard. Teams of three from all semesters competed against each other. The gooey glue and paper bits were innovatively united to reproduce the theme into a colourful piece of art. The event was judged by Dr. Bharti (Dept. of Pharmacology) and Dr. Vikram Palimar (Dept. of Forensic Medicine).

Winners:
1st: Arup, Siddharth, Jossil (6th semester)
2nd: Anwesha, Shivani, Ashwini (4th semester)
3rd: Jagrati Jain, Lakshay Rastogi, Anjori Gupta (2nd semester)

<ul>ENGLISH POETRY:</ul>
Spinning rhymes is no easy task, as many a poet would yield,

yet the talented contestants set up to bask, in witticisms and poignant deed.

Effortlessly weaving words, magic was hence created, spellbound were ladies and lords, who were in their presence seated.

Fiercely bards clashed, at the English Poetry event,

Until crowned were winners at long last, grinning broad and utterly spent.

Winners:
1st: Athira (6th Semester)
2nd: Manisha E.V. (6th Semester)
3rd: Ankit and Tanmay (6th Semester)
<ul>SPENT QUIZ:</ul>
Adrenaline pumped as spurts of sportive connections and leaps of movie logic materialized at the Sports and Entertainment (SpEnt) Quiz. A furious prelim round was chased by five high stakes final rounds, with scores changing in a topsy turvy manner, until a clear winner emerged at the home stretch. Tables were pounded and hands shot into the sky at brilliant questions and stupefyingly adept answerers.

<ul>CREATIVE VOCAL DUET:</ul>
With karaoke and instruments backing the singers, KMC greens resounded with melodies during Creative Duet Vocals.
