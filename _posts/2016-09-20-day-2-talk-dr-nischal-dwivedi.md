The Lindau Nobel Laureate meet, which in part inspired the genesis of IGCLA, can seem like a distant dream to many ambitious students. In part to quell such trepidation, Mr. Nischal Dwivedi spoke about his own experience as a delegate representing India in that August gathering.

Looking back fondly on those memories, he also shared a few lessons that the journey to Lindau taught him. He talked about embracing limitations and working to overcome them instead of being overwhelmed, and the importance of an ever curious mind in the pursuit of knowledge.
