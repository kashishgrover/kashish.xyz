Dr. Seema Mittal from Indian Innovation Research Centre delivered a lecture regarding a research undertaken by her with her colleagues to study intercellular communication in cancer metastasis (development of secondary malignant growths at a distance from a primary site of cancer). The agenda of the talk included the nature and method of communication between tumor cells and vascular endothelial cells, and how we can target this to prevent metastasis. They developed a 3-dimensional co-culture system mimicking the epithelial cells-endothelial cells co-culture. Nano-channels, the distinct projections specific to the tumor cells, were shown to be the functional conduits by the study. The cancer cells were pretreated with drugs called cytoskeletal inhibitors to study its effect on the nano- channels. The talk concluded with a vibrant question answer session.
