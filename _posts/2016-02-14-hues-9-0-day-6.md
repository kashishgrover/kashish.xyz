The sixth and final day of Hues 9.0 had to end with a Bang! And it did. From Singing to Mad Ads to Quizzes and of course, the Fashion Show, all proved to be major crowd pullers. Gathering applause and appreciation from students and faculty alike, it couldn’t have ended in a better way!

<strong>QUIZ FINALS</strong>

The Hues 9.0 Quiz Finals saw a furious battle amongst the teams as each of them tried to surpass the next. All the competing teams performed well. The finals went to show how well rounded and knowledgeable the MCODS students are.

Winners list:

1<sup>st</sup>- TIPS

2<sup>nd</sup>- 3<sup>rd</sup> Year

<strong>MAD ADS</strong>

One of the star attractions of today’s multi –event extravaganza was Mad Ads. The participating teams had to perform a live ad on a topic provided before-hand. Participating groups needed to display whacky and creative ideas and sell their products in the most innovative ways they could think of. It was the ultimate litmus for testing humor, content, acting skills and overall presentation. Only 1 team per batch was allowed. The event was judged by DrArun Urala and Dr Kalyan.
