The last talk of the morning session was Dr. Srikanth Prabhu, an alumnus of IIT-Kharagpur. He spoke at length on “Retinal Biometrics for Person Identification and Diabetic Retinopathy”. He taught the audience the art of retinal biometrics, mapping the retinal blood vessels and then about diabetic retinopathy. His talk was a reminder of the importance of collaboration between technology and medicine.
