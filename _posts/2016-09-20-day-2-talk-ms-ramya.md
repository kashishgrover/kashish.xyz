An introduction to the Medical Students Association of India served to bookend the talks on the first day of IGCLA 2016. Ms. Ramya illustrated the various levels of the organisation, showing how and where any interested party's prospects lay. She summarized the various activities and functions of MSAI, stressing that joining it was an opportunity that did not deserve to become a regret in hindsight.
