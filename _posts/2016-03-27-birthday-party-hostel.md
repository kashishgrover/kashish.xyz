Subtract three hundred and sixty four mundane days from your average mundane year. A remainder of twenty four hours are those which you wait for all those mundane eight thousand seven hundred and thirty six hours. I reckon the overuse of 'mundane' and some delirious math will help you see through.

Yes, it's your birthday! When calls from near and dear ones are raining, mom has a massive heartfelt gesture of love waiting to drown you whole and dad has your birthday gift waiting, you know it’s your day. There is this one element without which your day would be incomplete- friends! They can make any day go supernova, including your birthday. When you're far from home in a hostel and your parents' love doesn't suffice through Skype, worry not, your friends will readily fill that void!

Now, I’ll let you in on a little disclosure of what to expect on your big day and ways to make it even more special. Or even a shipwreck for that matter. Either way, fond memories are guaranteed.
Let's delay it no further and dive in!

1: <strong>The cliché:</strong> Gather around and wake up your birthday peep. Let the mellow tunes of that beloved happy birthday song fill the air. A method where cake serves its edible purpose. Pop some confetti, string some toffee filled balloons and voila! A way for the overly gentle one who does not welcome a havoc of any sort on her/his birthday.

2- <strong>Pizza rules the world:</strong> Pizza, an entity so versatile in its form that it'll fit any occasion. A pizza party coupled with The Godfather or that iconic Chelsea v/s Barcelona UCL 2005 (Keep the Blue Flag Flying High) or simply a F. R. I. E. N. D. S. marathon would work wonders.

3- <strong>Call in the Carom cohort:</strong> Picture that classic Munna Bhai MBBS carom scene- chilled beer, pizza (yes, it fits) and a carom king to be crowned with tons of banter
.
4- <strong>Savage in totality: </strong> I would not recommend this way by any means, no! (Though, I would suggest that you should let your diabolic side rule once in a while). So please don't pick those eggs, tomatoes, wafers, colours and what-nots to render your birthday peep a living garbage bin, who would be running after a shower and then eventually, your life.

5- <strong>Let the angels guide you on your lofty quest: </strong>
The Dan Brown reference here is crystal clear. Plot cues all through the hostel or in the campus premises, which lead up to a surprise birthday present. Remember, only by walking through the path of illumination can one find the Illuminati lair!

6- <strong>Room decoration, why not? : </strong> A common practice amongst girls, there is always this one person, a confidant who has a spare key to the birthday girl’s room. Decorate it in such a way that would render her awestruck. Boys, you can break this stereotype. Posters from Marvel or Koenigsegg are good for a start.

7- <strong>Just kill it: </strong> How about writing everything in reverse? Turn the idyllic into ruin; unleash a series of pranks which lead to total destruction! Well, why not swap vinegar for water, or devour a salt ridden cake? A cringe-worthy birthday ordeal today will surely make for a laughter worthy tale tomorrow.

8- <strong>Pour everything in a big bowl: </strong> Now that you have discrete ideas, mixing and mashing is always an option in accordance with whatever fits the time and place.

In the end, be sure to have fun and enjoy responsibly. And try not to leave the birthday boy or girl in a mess of disaster in the process.
Because, what goes around, comes around!
