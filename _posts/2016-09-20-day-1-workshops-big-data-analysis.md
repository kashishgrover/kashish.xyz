How do you perform research with so many facts and figures?

With that amount of data, analytics and statistics, rather than the actual clinical correlatives, the research data become your Damocles' sword.

Big data analytics examines large amounts of data to uncover hidden patterns, correlations and other insights. With today’s technology, it’s possible to analyze your data and get answers from it almost immediately – an effort that’s slower and less efficient with more traditional business intelligence solutions.

The importance of big data resolves around how the data is used, not on the amount of data. Its applications vary from Banking to Government and Health Care.

In the workshop, the students were taught :

o What exactly is ‘Big-Data’?

o Hadoop’s architecture and components
o Apache Spark – What it is and what are its advantages
o Resilient distributed dataset (RDD)

o A demo on Apache Spark

Held at BCLH-1, the students were required to bring their laptops. The workshop continued from 2-7 with an attendance of about 40.
