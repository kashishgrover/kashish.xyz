This included 2D analysis with problems based on internal and external flow. According to Deb Bhattacharya, the Chairperson of SAE India, Manipal, this workshop was the first of its kind in MIT which focused on CFD which is otherwise an open elective only. This workshop, a certified course, was conducted by MIT faculty who provided students with the tools to explore CFD.<a href="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/12983362_1198840430127200_3948446823961598565_o.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-2196"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2196" src="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/12983362_1198840430127200_3948446823961598565_o.jpg" alt="sae workshop" width="1620" height="1080" /></a>

Speaking on the whole experience of conducting the event, Chairperson of IE Aerospace, Dheer Verma, spoke about the overwhelming response they got for the workshop and how the organizers were getting requests even after all the slots were filled. The organizers plan to hold another workshop next semester to meet the demands of the students.<a href="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/13002326_1198840820127161_5356314108989693392_o.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-2199"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2199" src="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/13002326_1198840820127161_5356314108989693392_o.jpg" alt="labview" width="1920" height="911" /></a>
