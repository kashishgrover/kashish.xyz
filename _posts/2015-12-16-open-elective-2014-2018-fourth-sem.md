The Open Elective is a chance given by the college to delve deeper into the topics we have always wished to pursue, but haven't been able to due to the restrictions provided by our respective courses. It is a way to know about other branches, and not only does a sound knowledge of topics diverse and different from your own stream enhance your capabilities, it also does help immensely in whichever field you work later. Ever secretly harbored the wish to be an astronaut, but found yourself pursuing a boring course in electrical instead? Always fancied learning what your Computer Science peers studied? Here is the chance. We bring to you a detailed description of all the Open Electives for the fourth semester so that you can make a well thought-out decision while selecting your open electives. MTTN acknowledges all the seniors who helped provide a deeper insight into how the course proceeds as well as some tidbits about the professor and how the elective helps in the long run.
