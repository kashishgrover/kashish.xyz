<em><strong>The Experience:</strong></em>

You haven’t found any snowy furred beasts in Manipal, thanks to the heat. Though, you’ll find something similar to beat the sun – Polar Bear! With outlets both in Manipal and Udupi, we chose to review the latter.

<a href="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_4774.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-2162"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-2162 size-large" src="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_4774-1024x683.jpg" alt="IMG_4774" width="658" height="439" /></a>

Polar Bear serves a myriad of ice creams, sandwiches and shakes to suit virtually any palate, ice creams being their strong suit. Manipal/ Udupi now has a place, fit for a great summery hangout with friends and family. The milieu is decent with air conditioning, comfy seating and ambient music in the backdrop.

Dazzled by the ingenious menu, we chose to go with the recommendations. All dishes were well presented, neither too gaudy nor too dull. They tasted as their names promised (more in the recommendations section). The staff were polite and courteous. You may have to wait for quite some time before your order turns up. Standard hygiene practices were followed in the kitchen and on the table. Any day is ideal to visit the place.

Note: The place is is suitable to host birthday treats and also provides home delivery (calls and Foodzoned.com).

<em><strong>Recommendations:</strong></em>

1 – Black magic: An ice cream – fruitcake fusion (might not please a few).

2 – Death by chocolate: Can’t go wrong with it. Period.

3 – Fruit zest: A sundae, quite literally surprising on multiple levels.
