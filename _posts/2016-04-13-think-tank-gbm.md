Manipal is a hub of inspiration and youth in pursuit of motivation. Aiming to cultivate this idea, The Think Tank held its General Body Meeting followed by recruitment on Friday. Nine well-dressed, outspoken individuals delivered their newly born club’s first GBM. The President of the club, Abhay Sahni, commenced the meeting by explaining the “Why” of their club, followed by their publicity head elaborating on how they plan to achieve it and the General Secretary, Dhruv Verma, talking about what their club will actually do.
<ul>
	<li>Their “Why”</li>
</ul>
The Think Tank emerged as a consequence of  a deficit of inspiration amongst people, and this club’s main objective is to encourage innovation, motivation and creation.
<ul>
	<li>Their “How”</li>
</ul>
By providing sufficient knowledge and education, The Think Tank aims to empower the youth to take collective steps for a better future.
<ul>
	<li>Their “What”</li>
</ul>
The Think Tank will largely be involved in organizing talks, interactive sessions and workshops (both technical as well as non-technical) for students.

Taking the stage again, the president finally unveiled the “big surprise” mentioned in their posters which had everyone’s curiosity spiked- they took a step no other club/organization has ever before, and obtained the license for bringing TEDx to Manipal! Post that revelation, each of the 7 department heads came forth to give a brief overview of their respective departments (with both Finance &amp; Sponsorship head and the PR &amp; Content head claiming their divisions to be the backbone of the club). The GBM terminated with the forum being opened for questions, following which the recruitment process began. The Logistics and Hospitality departments will recruit next semester.

As of now, Think Tank is a university-based club. The publicity team, however, plans to expand to regions beyond Manipal as well.
