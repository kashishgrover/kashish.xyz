With the increasing popularity of meaningful music, it’s almost poetry. A more expressible and popular version of the literature. The Local Train is a band that has grown to gain acclaim in a short time period of one year and one album. Their performance at the MIT Quadrangle was one of the best and most crowded events ever held in Manipal.

A four member team, the band has a simple and charming demeanour. As they set up the stage the video of their song ‘Dil mere’ played on the screen. Serene and picturesque, the video expressed the sheer passion they possess for the music they create. They opened the concert night with ‘Manzil’ a popular and soulful number. It’s about desires and ambitions and the will of man to achieve them. They went on to sing most of their own compositions with energy and enthusiasm.

The audience was simply marvelous with their timely responses, chants and hoots. They never missed a beat or a lyric. Like all artists that visit Manipal, they too felt the love and appreciation from them. A crowd this encouraging is a sight worth seeing. Spontaneously, everyone switched on their phone torch lights and lit up the ground. All starry and glittery, the quadrangle has never looked so beautiful.

The theme of Revels’16, Daastan, Everybody’s story, seemed to greatly impress these artists, and they too took moments out of their show to talk to the crowd and let us know their story. They talked about how they grew from a single melody into a band such, and about the shooting of ‘dil mere’ in Himachal in the intense cold.

The band had a great energy in them. The bassist kept jumping all around stage, and the head-banging of the lead guitarist. The drummers incessant clapping kept everyone in a trance. They played two songs ‘Khudi’ and ‘O Ganje’ that haven’t been released yet. The former waqs about listening to your pride and ego, the other about corruption.

They payed ‘Dil Chahta hai’ Lucky Ali’s ‘ Tere mere saath’ and ‘Dil se’ all songs that have remained valid and appreciated for time immemorial. These songs relate to many a people in many walks of life, and are inspirational, much like TLT’s music.

To end with, a lyric from Khudi that absolutely touched the heart

<em>“Khudi ko Khud se Milane chala hai O deewane”</em>

(To make your pride and ability meet your entire being, is art, is passion)

The concert was a glowing success, with impeccable musicians, lights that make you feel alive, and music that touched the very depths of the soul.
