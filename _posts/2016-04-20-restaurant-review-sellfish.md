Sellfish was conceived as a gustatory tour of the aquatic world, and that shows in every fiber of the restaurant. The subtle aquamarine light dipping down on patrons and the pebbled wallpaper evoking clear rivers and beautiful riverbeds, all bolstered by soft rustling music creates an unique dining experience.

<a href="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_4927.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-2274"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2274 size-full" src="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG_4927.jpg" alt="IMG_4927" width="5184" height="3456" /></a>

The menu consists of exotic dishes, seafood in familiar preparations, and a thoughtful addition of a few choice chicken dishes as well, however, there is a conspicuous absence of choices for vegetarian palates. On our visit, the food was scrumptious, with particular emphasis on traditional preparations of seafood. Subtle cooking appears to be their forte, going a tad heavy-handed on the spice. The adjoining bread basket is commendable, and the biryanis are a hearty must try.

Being a new restaurant, the personal touch is quite profound at Sellfish, and even though it isn’t a place for large parties, a small group looking to explore or revisit good seafood may find it an ideal visit. The prices vary seasonally, but they provide the assurance of choice cuisine throughout the year.
