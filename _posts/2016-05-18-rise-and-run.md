The clock strikes 6 AM. The alarm bell rings out a loud deafening tone; the walls echoing back the notes of the alarm. As I rub my eyes, I look at the watch that lies next to my bed. Relieved, that it was still too early, I doze off again. The next time I wake up, a house falls on my head and I break wind. It is three minutes to the start of class. How did I manage to sleep so much?

Given that this has been my lifestyle for quite sometime now, there are certain life hacks I fall back upon, to make it to class:

<strong>Life hack #1</strong>: You are not a toothpaste model! Three or four rough strokes of the brush is all that you need in these dire straits.

<strong>Life hack #2</strong>: The Night Shower. If you are much like me anticipating the morning race to class, then you must be a believer in the concept of a night shower. It sustains you for the first half of the day and that's all you should be caring about, at that point of time!

<strong>Life hack #3</strong>: Three minute rule. We, at KMC, have biometric attendance. The ten minutes' buffering time to imprint your fingerprint into the machine is valuable. Hence, you're not racing to class to reach at 8.30. It's about reaching by the third minute after the commencement of class so that you  can somehow put your mark into the system and don't lose attendance.

<strong>Life hack #4</strong>: The Washroom excuse. As you enter the class a bit late, the odd professor might detain and question you about your punctuality. But for all you knew, Nature's calling had gotten the better of you and you had to leave to answer it much before he arrived. Now that you return, you are at awe to see him there.

<strong>Life hack #5</strong>: On-the-go. If you are as often late to class as I am, you will have the practice and mastery of certain activities which you do while you're running to class. Namely, adjusting your hair, buttoning your shirt and putting on the belt: all of it whilst you run with untied laces.

<strong>Life hack #6</strong>: SIS. Woah! It's 10. By now, you've missed the first two lectures. Don't fret over it. Keeping fingers crossed, check SIS to see how much attendance you have and relieve yourself of the guilt of missing classes. SIS, after all, reinforces your belief in Karma: As you sleep, you shall weep.

Morning sleep is an essential part of life. Wriggling under your blanket with the AC turned on is a habit few of us have gotten over.

However, having said all this, there are times wisdom might dawn upon you, should you have missed too many classes because of sloth. In those times of epiphany, Phillip Doddridge's analysis of time shall give you a sense of purpose to rise early. As he once said:

<em>"The difference between rising at five and seven o' clock in the morning for forty years, supposing a man to go to bed at the same hour at night, is nearly equivalent to the addition of ten years to a man's life."</em>
