The fifth and final talk of the evening was by Tanvi Sinha, who is an alumnus of Manipal university. She spoke to the audience about the Teach for India campaign. She shared a very inspiring video presentation about educational inequity in our country and how a lot of children get to go to school but are still not getting access to good quality education. She urged everyone present to participate whether full time or as volunteers at the different centres. With that the session came to an end as the crowd headed for a coffee break.
