The emergency medicine workshop began at 9:00 am at the health sciences library. It was conducted by Dr.Naman Agarwal, AIIMS. It was attended by a group of nearly fifty people consisting of second and third year medical students hailing from KMC as well as other medical colleges. The event began with a group activity where the participants were divided into teams and given scenarios where CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) cannot be performed, yet some form of intervention is necessary to help the patient. This was followed by a lecture on the benefits of ultrasound as a technique to diagnose emergency medical conditions including pulmonary edema, pulmonary embolism, tension pneumothorax, shock, fractures .etc.
The cherry on top was a Treasure Hunt, which was greeted with an enthusiastic response. The teams were given their first clues and then dispersed to search for their next at locations distributed all around the campus culminating in a case which they had to solve.
