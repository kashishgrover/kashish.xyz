With the exam season back in town, students who have just given their 12<sup>th</sup> boards are gearing up to face the actual competitive exams to enter their new phase of life. Here are a few tips and tricks to ace the Manipal Online Entrance Test – for MBBS:

&nbsp;
<ol>
	<li><strong>NCERT textbooks = Sacred book</strong></li>
</ol>
It is indeed a cliché statement, but the truth shouldn’t be denied. Get yourself acquainted as well as thorough in all the topics covered in these books because most of the questions relate to them. Referring to additional recommended books would, of course be worthwhile!

&nbsp;
<ol start="2">
	<li><strong>Solve lot of previous year question papers</strong></li>
</ol>
Working out question papers boost your confidence. Time yourself for less than the actual duration of the exam (two and half hours) to complete one full paper, this would really help you as you would then have sufficient time in the end to go through the doubtful ones.

&nbsp;
<ol start="3">
	<li><strong>Concept clearance</strong></li>
</ol>
As the exam is just a few days away, it neither would be possible nor is it advisable to read through the books completely. Thus it would be better, you check and mark/grade your performance for every paper you solve. For every mistake you commit, get back and refer that concept. Revise it in such a way that you would be able to answer any sort of question posed!

&nbsp;
<ol start="4">
	<li><strong>Handy-list</strong></li>
</ol>
Prepare a list of formulae (for Physics) and important reactions (for Chemistry) which is to be revised before the test. Believe me, this would be a saviour!

&nbsp;
<ol start="5">
	<li><strong>Theory of elimination</strong></li>
</ol>
Since all the questions are of multiple-choice type, this is the best trick. In almost 80% of the questions, two options would be such that they’re completely unrelated to the question and hence could be eliminated (a completely hypothetical theory, but did work out for many). It is now comparatively easier to choose the right answer with 50% probability for each.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
<ol start="6">
	<li><strong>Do not Panic</strong></li>
</ol>
Face every question with a Stance of Confidence and Surge of Determination! Never ever get disheartened or demotivated. Keep calm and do your best! Digest a lot of heathy food such as fresh fruits, almonds and do drink a lot of water. This enhances the activity of one’s brain.  Also, do take a few breaks in between to relax your mind. On the same note, stay away from distractions such as Video games or starting to watch a new TV series.

&nbsp;
