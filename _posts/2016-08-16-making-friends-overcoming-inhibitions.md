Not very often in life are you struck with an amazing opportunity to meet new people, while some people make the greatest use of this, many others are still trying to fight away their hesitation and remain oblivious to the wonderment that new alliances can bring into one’s life. The greater part of the public is not very outgoing and lack the conviction to meet new people. Some, on the other hand, seem convinced with their satisfaction at the happy isolation they experience. They probably do not find the effort to make new friends worthwhile. In any case, making a conscious effort alone leads to anything worthwhile. Hoping for something to happen by chance is the worst way to exercise one’s mind.

The variety of humans one will run into in Manipal is somewhat refreshing. From doctors who write poetry to teachers who trek, Manipal is home to interesting people of all sorts.

Making new friends is something that many consider out of their comfort zone. By nature of our survival we will definitely end up acquiring some friends/ associates or confidants through our journey, but having the power to wilfully choose whom we would like to fill those positions is not as common as it ought to be.

A small change in the approach one takes to the idea of meeting people and making friends can make a substantial difference to their future encounters. A slight interaction with a stranger is not considered a real contact and is quickly thought of as unimportant. An acquaintance is lost the very moment you fail to acknowledge a previous interaction.

Next, it would be better if we could stop being rather overly self-conscious, contrary to popular thought it might not always be right to accept who you are. Perhaps accepting and undertaking the burden involved in becoming what you want to be is of greater importance.

Another thing we can be modestly sure of is that most people think in a similar manner. If you do not find the way you start a conversation to be crude or annoying there is a great chance that your counterpart would feel the same way, and hence all apprehension can be thrown out the window.

Sometimes the act of reaching out to strangers is deemed ‘desperate’ or even childish. Do not ever give in to that outlook. Whenever you embark on something that is not easy for you the least that can happen is that the experience alone turns out to be altogether educating. A common fear among people is the fear of perception and its effect on one’s life. As far as I can think the only time you should be worried about what strangers might think of you is when you run for a public office. In all other situations it hardly matters if you choose not to be bothered by it.

It lies solely upon ourselves to find a better audience for our minds. A more understanding, motivating and uplifting set of people is just around the corner. Don’t stick to people with whom you merely get along; instead search for people who you really connect with.

Being open minded will lead to exciting associations. The more open you are to the choice of people you’d want to meet the more surprising the enterprise will be.

In closing, allow me to quote Walt Whitman,

<em>“Stranger, if you passing meet me and desire to speak to me, why should you not speak to me? And why should I not speak to you?”</em>
