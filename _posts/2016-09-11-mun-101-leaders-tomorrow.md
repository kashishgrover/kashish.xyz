The Model United Nations training session, or the "MUN training session" as a rookie or veteran of the field would call it, was organized on 9th September,2016 by Leaders of Tomorrow, a one-of-a-kind club set to revive the spirit of ‘MUNing’ in Manipal and inculcate a knowledge of domestic and world affairs. Held in NLH 303, premise of the event was to help people inculcate an interest in Model United Nations and guide them through the rules of any Model UN while teaching tips and tricks of the trade, because it definitely isn't easy.

Although the event was meant to focus on second and third years, the room was packed with about a hundred over-enthusiastic first years, which was extremely appreciated by the Student Council, who not wanting to kill this conundrum of enthusiasm, let them stay.

The workshop took place in two stages. The first bit included a run through about absolutely everything that can be explained about a Model United Nations in less than two hours. Although it is quite difficult to make first timers understand the rules of procedure in an MUN, the extremely interactive and cracking format ensured that every person sitting within the confines of NLH 303 not only understood Model UN procedure, but also absolutely loved the idea behind it.

The most important aspect that was explained was the flow of an MUN, which happens to be the biggest ordeal for any first timer. Deliberation at any Model UN would usually begin with the establishment of the General Speakers List which includes a list of all countries wanting to speak on the agenda in a very generic manner. Specifics were first discussed in Moderated and Unmoderated Caucus. After that, the discussion of all sub topics of the Agenda in the moderated caucus would take place and the committee would come up with a resolution, which is simply the solution to all problems discussed. Often delegates participating for the first time get confused with the flow, but the presenters,Dhruv Suri and Dhruv Verma ensured that they didn’t move on until all questions, no matter how frivolous, were answered.

To test how much of the information presented had actually been retained, and more importantly, to infuse the entire MUN experience within everyone’s mind, a mock committee was simulated. People actually joked about the experience being a "Model" Model UN, and although some struggled to not use personal pronouns, the sheer exuberance with which everything was presented inculcated a desire for more. We’re sure Youth Parliament, an event organized by Leaders of Tomorrow in the coming month, will see the same enthusiasm and diaspora of emotions as this workshop. Stay tuned for more updates.
