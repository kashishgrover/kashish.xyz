ELISA is an indispensable tool if we, as doctors, want to correctly diagnose a variety of viral, parasitic or spirochaetal infections. Hence, the workshop on ELISA, conducted in the Department of Microbiology, was immensely beneficial to all those who attended it. Dr. Renuka, Department of Microbiology, kickstarted the workshop with an initial briefing of the attendees to the works and wonders of ELISA. The attendees were then shown the different types and techniques of the procedure, following which they had to solve medical cases using the ELISA kits provided to them. Dr. Chiranjoy, Department of Microbiology then had an interactive case discussion with the gathering. He also continually handed out tips on diagnosing patients in the clinical world. It was an interactive, intellectual and invaluable workshop for the participants.
