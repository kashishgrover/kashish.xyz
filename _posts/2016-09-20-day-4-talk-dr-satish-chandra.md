Dr Satish Chandra’s topic “Overview of Polio Endgame Strategy: Rationale of Introduction of IPV and bOPV” made for a very interesting talk indeed. He spoke about the endgame plan and the rationale for withdrawal of the oral polio vaccine (OPV) eventually and the simultaneous introduction of the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). IPV is to be given in two fractional doses. He made us aware about the vaccine derived polio outbreaks and the globally synchronized withdrawal of trivalent OPV on National Switch Day, 25th April 2016 to be replaced by the bivalent OPV and IPV. This will later be followed by replacement of the bivalent OPV by the monovalent OPV and ultimately the absolute withdrawal of OPV and replace it entirely by the IPV.
