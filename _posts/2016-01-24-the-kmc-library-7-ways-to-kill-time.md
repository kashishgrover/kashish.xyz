<strong>Library </strong>[Lahy-brer-ee]

<em>Noun, plural</em>: <strong>libraries</strong>

A place set apart to contain books, periodicals and other material for reading, viewing, listening, studying or reference, as a room, set of rooms, or building where books may be read or borrowed.

Thus reads the dictionary meaning of ‘library’ (yes, I’m secretly Captain Obvious). The world abides by this glossary. However, being a student has its own occupational hazards, of which the greatest is flouting ALL the rules. After all, rules are made to be broken. So why spare the library?

Ergo, we KMC-ites (some by choice, some by the lack of it), have concocted a soup of benefits that can be availed at our treasured library.

<strong>A forum to discuss how screwed we are</strong>. The lobby of the library is used exclusively for the purpose of creating gravity around exams (yeah, because there really isn’t enough already). Want to taunt others on grounds of having studied everything for the *insert number here* time? Want to victimize yourself against the same? Indubitably, the library is your go-to place.

<strong>Begging, borrowing &amp; stealing wifi.</strong> Hands down, this is what makes the library so alluring to all. So if one sits there from 11 AM to 11PM on a Sunday, it’s an open secret that it was for the plethora of movies available online (what did you think, textbooks?). Robbins or Davidsons can only be that enticing. (Med Students should know.)

<strong>Counting coffee cups to measure our study time</strong> (read: lack of sleep). Be it for imprinting the branches of the radial nerve in our minds or for the clinical manifestations of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (sorry, couldn’t resist), that humble little coffee stall inside our library has been a life-saver whenever the brain has cried “OVERLOAD” and threatened to pack up. By firsthand experience, a lot can really happen over coffee. More so if it’s in the library. (See what I did there? There’s a CCD inside too.)

<strong>Public Display of Affection</strong>. Libraries are for learning, and love is quite the lesson to be learnt.  A huge number of students subscribe to that (and take the ‘library’ part a bit too seriously). So, if you believe that ‘love’ and ‘care’ is lost in this nuke generation, a glance inside the group discussion area should do you good, because this small room has seen more than enough love to prove otherwise.

<strong>Exploring the abundant periodicals and journals</strong>. Our library contains a surplus of them. Yeah, seems a humdrum, but this really is a huge asset for those who are into research. Also of course, for those with that rare, precious, unheard-of gift from God called ‘patience’.

<strong>Feeling good about oneself</strong>. The number of hours spent in the library is inversely proportional to how redundant and lethargic one feels. Never mind that 95 percent of our ‘library-time’ is spent either sleeping or doing any of the above-mentioned debaucheries.

<strong>Going for some serious undercover studying</strong>. Let’s face it, we’re doomed if anyone catches us studying.  Of course, we can’t hide and study in our rooms because the bed and blanket just won’t permit that. Thus, when exams come, we see (or rather, <em>don’t </em>see) students tiptoeing up to some obscure corner on the fourth floor to cram. Let’s not deny it, we’ve all been there, done that.

Happening and dynamic, our library is a separate world in itself.

These were just a few choice uses for our library. I’m sure you know many more; feel free to share them by leaving a comment!

There is, after all, a library of options.
