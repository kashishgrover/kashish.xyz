<div style="text-align: left" align="left"><span style="color: #333333"><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif"><span style="font-size: medium">The Open Elective is one of the few instances in our engineering life when we get the chance to choose what we want to learn about; something outside of our own stream, our comfort zone. It's an opportunity to inculcate some interdisciplinary education, so that we aren't completely oblivious to the roles that other disciplines play in our lives. Ever wished to just learn about the teachings of Gandhi and Martin Luther King? Why, here is the chance.</span></span></span></div>
<div style="text-align: left" align="left"></div>
<div style="text-align: left" align="left"><span style="color: #333333"><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif"><span style="font-size: medium">We bring to you a detailed description of almost all the Open Electives for the sixth semester so that you can make a well thought-out decision. MTTN acknowledges all the seniors who helped provide a deeper insight into the course syllabus, as well as some tidbits about the professor and how useful the elective is for your resume. This list is not fully exhaustive, as you can see, and we're working right now on getting verified information to you as soon as possible. Please bear with us, and All the best!</span></span></span></div>
<div style="text-align: left" align="left"></div>
<span class="im"><strong><span style="color: #333333"><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif"><span style="font-size: medium">AAE 348 - Aircraft and Space Transportation System</span></span></span></strong></span><span style="color: #333333"><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif"><span style="font-size: medium">
The course syllabus is said to be mostly easy, so you can score well with minimal amount of studying. The professor is a nice fellow and lenient when it comes to attendance.</span></span></span>

<strong><span style="color: #333333"><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif"><span style="font-size: medium">AAE 384 - Automotive Pollution and Control</span></span></span></strong><span style="color: #333333"><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif"><span style="font-size: medium">
This course has bits of thermodynamics and basic automobile engineering concepts. The faculty is largely good, and it’s easy to score once you grasp the concepts. It’s good for the CV if you’re going for an industrial job later on.</span></span></span>

<strong><span style="color: #333333"><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif"><span style="font-size: medium">BIO 318 - Industrial Biotechnology</span></span></span></strong>

<span style="color: #333333"><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif"><span style="font-size: medium"> This is one course which seems to be kinda laid-back, but is the exact opposite. There is a lot of rote learning involved. The professor is pretty good at the subject, so opt for this only if you're really interested.</span></span></span>

<strong><span style="color: #333333"><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif"><span style="font-size: medium">CIE 344 - Contract Management</span></span></span></strong><span style="color: #333333"><span style="font-family: Georgia, serif"><span style="font-size: medium">
This course describes the life cycle of a project contract and how it’s supposed to be carried out. It’s an easy and scoring elective. The faculty is sadly essentially average. Not very helpful for the CV.</span></span></span>
