When you are tired after having attended four hours of class and three hours of lab, all you want is a peaceful recline where you can forget about the rest of the world’s problems and escape to some fulfilling siesta. Deciding which hostel to take for the year can therefore be a tedious job. For the next whole college year, it is this room which will witness your troubled break-outs (or breakups) the aftermath of many ecstatic or depressing phone conversations, some happy moments, some sad and leave you with a vivid feeling of belongingness, such that you will end up missing your block once this ends.

This is exactly why we want you to make a well-informed decision before you apply for the hostels. From bed sizes to spacious corridors, washrooms to ventilation, we have you covered. Take a look at the various blocks and what they have in store for you, so that you do not regret it once you are allotted the room you’re about to live in for the next one year.

<strong>13th Block:</strong>

It is the largest girls block in MIT, accommodating a total of 642 students in single/double AC/non-AC rooms. The early morning view from the extension balcony is one of the best in Manipal.

<a href="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/View-from-13th-block-6th-floor-extension-balcony.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-1652"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1652" src="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/View-from-13th-block-6th-floor-extension-balcony-724x1024.jpg" alt="View from 13th block 6th floor extension balcony" width="658" height="931" /></a>

<strong>LAYOUT:</strong>

There are eight floors, six in the main building and two additional floors in the extension. The 3rd, 4th and 5th floors have only non-AC rooms and all the remaining floors have both AC and non-AC rooms.

Every room has an attached bathroom.

Students can avail the mess facility either from Ashraya (veg/non-veg) or Ananya (only veg), which is within the hostel premises.

This is the time of the year again when your roommate convincing skills are put to test. All the loyalties built over the year compared to petty friendships and the difficult truths confront you while you make the choice of a single over a double room, or resort to the fate your GPA has decided for you. While you choose the perfect hostel, with the perfect roommate- be precarious at the least, since once it's done, it's done. With exceptions of course.
