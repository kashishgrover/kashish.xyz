The second talk of the afternoon was by Dr. Yaseen Emanee. His lecture was about the possibility of conducting research in rural areas and its feasibility. He also dwelt on the existing difficulty of health care professionals in rural areas, including the conditions in which doctors are forced to work. This was followed by questions from the audience.
