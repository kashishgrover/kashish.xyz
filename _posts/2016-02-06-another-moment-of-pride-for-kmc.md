The 4<sup>th </sup>edition of the renowned Holland and Brews Manual of Obstetrics was released on the 5th of February, 2016 in a glittering ceremony at the TMA Pai Hall in the presence of eminent personalities, the administrators, faculty and students of Kasturba Medical College - Manipal University.

The Chief Guest was none other than, our honorable Chancellor Dr. Ramdas Pai. Among the dignitaries present were Dr. HS Ballal (Pro Chancellor), Dr. Poornima Baliga (Dean of KMC, Manipal), Dr. M Venkatraya Prabhu (Dean of KMC, Mangalore), and a stalwart in the field of obstetrics, senior editor of Holland and Brews Manual of Obstetrics, Dr. Shirish Daftary.

<a href="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_9965.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-932"><img class=" wp-image-932 aligncenter" src="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/IMG_9965-300x170.jpg" alt="IMG_9965" width="356" height="202" /></a>

The men of the moment, Dr. Muralidhar V Pai and Dr. Prahlad Kushtagi, editors of Holland and Brews Manual of Obstetrics, were all smiles as Dr. Pratap Kumar Narayan (Professor-Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology), Dr. Lavanya Rai (Head of Department of OBG-KMC,Manipal) and Dr. Priya Ballal (Head of Department of OBG-KMC, Mangalore) praised the crisp, intelligent and organized content of the book, which they believe will cater to every need of a student pursuing the subject.

Dr. HS Ballal calls the book, " a one stop textbook and a fast food restaurant" for every OBG student. Spearheaded by Dr. Shirish Daftary, and edited by the very capable Dr. Muralidhar V Pai and Dr Prahlad Kushtagi, there is no doubt that this fourth edition will continue the legacy of Holland and Brews Manual of Obstetrics.
