<blockquote>A fest is remembered for the artist that bore it and the makers who sew it.</blockquote>
&nbsp;

The first day of Revels raised the bar of expectations by organizing such an event. GROOVES, under the category of Footloose, celebrated dance and its preachers. The competition witnessed the participation of several Engineering colleges. The cheers and encouragement of the crowd added to the enthusiasm of the performers. It was judged by Mr. Ravindra and Mr. Eric from Terence Lewis Dance Company. The judgement parameters for the competition were synchronization, costume and dance steps. The competition was razor sharp, with each team outshining the others. Soon after it was over, the judges addressed the crowd and appreciated the participants. Winners were declared and Blitzkreig brought the glory home.

The most anticipated moment for the crowd was when the man of the evening, and celebrity dance show judge, Terence Lewis walked on to the stage and introduced his act for the evening, SHOONYA. The act was a captivating combination of art and culture. It focused on the evolution of mankind and <em>shoonya</em>(zero).

<a href="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ftg.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-1381"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1381 size-full" src="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/ftg.jpg" alt="ftg" width="635" height="960" /></a>

When Aryabhatta introduced <em>shoonya</em> (zero), he made the biggest contribution to the world of mathematics and science. The very presence of this solo digit has the power to turn the world upside down. The civilization of mankind was a lengthy process. The period of renaissance saw the birth of great artists like Leonardo Da Vinci, Galileo, Michealangelo and Picasso. The birth of art and culture took place. Leonardo Da Vinci was not only a painter but also an architect, a sculpture artist, a scientist, a biologist, and much more. He gave the world the god particle Phi. He believed that the god particle created everything on the earth and beyond. One of his most illustrious works was probably the creation of the Vitruvian man. The architect believed that man was divinely created with perfect measurements. The performance comprised of showing all of these in small separate acts and explaining the concept of evolution. It was then followed by acts that depicted the cycle of life. All the dreams, survival, seasons and eventually the death of a human. These acts explained the eventual growth of man to what he is now. What followed next was the survival of man in the world. The acts were based on what the choreographer, Terence felt about his city, Mumbai, "the city of dreams". It enacted what happens when you are stranded in a jungle and caught among the wilderness. You run, crawl and fight to survive and keep moving on. After the dream, comes the understanding of the power of love. It was followed by a beautiful ballet that showed two people falling in love for the first time. As the saying goes,<em>"Its better to have loved and lost then to have never loved"</em>.

After this, the story moved on to life in a boy’s hostel. It generalized the crowd into three individuals, one being the body builder another being flirtatious and the third being a frequent alcoholic. This act was named "Where is my remote?" and was based on the friendship among them. It is during the college and school days that you make true friends. Life is all about going back and returning to these friendships. The act depicted several stages of human revolution and growth. This act which was inspired by the life of Terence Lewis himself, had the perfect ending with him declaring his love and passion for dance.

The crowd went into frenzy when he finally performed with his crew. A true artist is somebody who can make others feel. After the performance, the entire crew was introduced on stage. The inspiring stories of his crew on how they followed their passion moved hearts. Terence Lewis, the man of the night was euphoric when they received a standing ovation from the crowd. He thanked Dr. G.K Prabhu, Director, MIT and the President of Student Council for bringing him to the fest. Dr. G.K Prabhu addressed the gathering and thanked Terence Lewis for coming and inspiring the audience. The iconic moment of the night was when he wore the revels shirt and took a selfie with the crowd calling it the most "chumeshwari audience" ever.
