<blockquote>They say that the wheel is the most significant discovery mankind has ever made.</blockquote>
&nbsp;

Holding testimony to this saying, SAE-IM has organized an industrial visit to the Michelin India factory situated in Chennai. SAE-IM held its orientation on 29 February 2016, regarding this visit. The orientation was conducted by the SAE-IM president Deb Bhattacharya, who explained the objective of this entire venture. The presentation started with a brief introduction on the tire manufacturing business and the numerous processes involved in making of “the perfect commercial tire”.

The presentation took a scientific route, and the principles of various intermediate processes such as rubber compound formation, steel chord preparation, tread extrusion, tire curing, etc., were introduced and explained in brief. The big scientific terms which earlier made no sense, were made crystal clear since the presentation method and clarity of explanation was remarkable. Everyone in the room seemed impressed and awestruck by the amount of scientific knowledge and years of research that went into making the tire, a product which we see daily but never appreciate. All these concepts will be again taught in detail during the visit.

The final highlight was a video by Michelin International which comprehensively and visually summarized the entire described process.

To be a part of the visiting team, one needs to attempt the screening test, which will be based on general automotive and mechanical engineering aptitude. This test will be held on 2 March 2016 at AB5-303, exclusively for second and third year students of Automobile, Aeronautical, and Mechanical branches. The top 13 candidates get the golden opportunity to visit Michelin India Pvt. Ltd. Factory, Chennai, wherein they will be a given a grand tour of the industrial section. Students will be taught about, and will see live demonstrations of the entire tire manufacturing process, which will give them an exact idea about how things usually work in such industries.

<em>What will students gain out of this trip?</em>

This industrial visit will provide the students with an opportunity to plan, organize, and engage in an active learning experience. Moreover, it will equip the students with the industrial practices and working knowledge about industries. Along the way, they will develop great interpersonal and analytical skills while talking to the workers and important factory authorities. Also, they will experience the real working environment inside a world class factory, and gain an insight into the entire mega tire manufacturing procedures. This is an initiative to inculcate scientific fervor and an innovative urge among the students. The students shall be awarded with a certificate authorized by SAE and Manipal University on the successful completion of the trip, but the experience you obtain will undoubtedly be priceless.
