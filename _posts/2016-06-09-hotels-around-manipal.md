For many of us, Manipal is a brand new town—and hence this article will be a guide in choosing the best hotels in and around Manipal &amp; Udupi that would make your stay, easy and comfortable.

<strong> 1. Madhuvan Serai</strong>
Located minutes away from Tiger Circle, Madhuvan Serai is well known for its esteemed service. It is a renowned family hotel, which has a restaurant and bar as well. Their rooms are spacious and well-ventilated, where proper sanitation and cleanliness is taken care of. The hotel’s proximity to the bus stand, rickshaw stand and railway station makes it one of the best places to stay at Manipal. It is at walking distance to KMC, SOC and MIT as well. The staff is cordial, and the restaurant is known to serve delicious food around the clock. It is cost-effective as well!

This is an apartment hotel, which is built right behind the EDU Library, and barely a 10-minute walk to the main KMC campus.
