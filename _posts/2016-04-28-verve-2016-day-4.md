TURNCOAT

What do you really believe in?
Turncoat, held in Interact GB, left the participants in this dilemma as they had to present opposing sides of the motion they were given. Motions ranged from the usage of PR campaigns being a better alternative to military action against terrorism, to the evils of science.
The event was marked by the promptness with which the participants prepared their speech in 2 min and how they could effectively present both sides of the argument.

Winners:
1st: Dharini (2nd Semester)

2nd: Athira (6th Semester)

3rd: Anusha (6th Semester)
