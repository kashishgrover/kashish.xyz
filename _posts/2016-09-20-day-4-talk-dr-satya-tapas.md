Dr Satya Tapas of Centre for Cellular and Molecular Platforms, Bengaluru gave a small insight into the world of molecular biology with his talk on “Molecular Structure to Medicine: A Journey of 100 Years”. He spoke about the history of solving structures of various proteins using diffraction and how it is very difficult to develop on the topic in India due to the lack of a suitable synchrotron radiation facility. He also spoke about his article “Structural Insight into DFMO Resistant Ornithine Decarboxylase from Entamoeba histolytica: An Inkling to Adaptive Evolution”.
