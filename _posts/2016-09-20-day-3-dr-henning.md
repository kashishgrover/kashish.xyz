In his second visit to Manipal, Dr. Henning Hintzsche spoke about his work with Vinca alkaloids. He reminisced about how vinca alkaloids were first experimented with as potential anti-diabetic drugs. It was only as an accident, that the ability of these drugs to kill white blood cells, was discovered. Whilst explaining his research, he emphasized the need to review literature before starting a research project. He also encouraged the audience to be open to ideas, because research can many a times take very different courses than what we might expect.
