<strong>The fee structure this time has been simplified into two parts :</strong>

<strong>1 - The Hostel + Mess Fees (Yes, they’re combined)</strong>

<strong>2 - The Academic Fees</strong>

&nbsp;

The total fees for the various hostels can be found at your sis portal: sis.manipal.edu

You need to call the college to know your utility balance and dues. Call this number to do that: 0820-2925523

Note: You don’t need to pay the Hostel Deposit again if you already did in your first year. You can deduct this from the sum. If you have Hostel Dues or Mess Dues, you need to add it to this sum.

<em>Note: If you are shifting to a hostel with higher Hostel Deposit than you had last time, you need to pay the difference.</em>

&nbsp;

You need to carry with you a <strong>confirmation of your online payment or a photocopy of your DD</strong> which you need to show to the Hostel caretaker and to the Mess authorities.

The due date for submission of Hostel and Mess Fees is 9th August.

There following are the ways to pay the Hostel Fee and Mess Fees:

&nbsp;
<ol>
	<li><strong>Through Demand Draft (DD): </strong>A single DD for hostel + mess fees needs to be drawn in favour of <strong>‘<em>MAHE  HOSTELS</em>‘ </strong>payable at <strong>Manipal/Udupi</strong>. This DD has to be remitted in the respective Hostel accounting office.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
<ol start="2">
	<li><strong>2</strong>. <strong>Through ICICI Bank (RTGS/NEFT): </strong>The second way is by a bank transfer and the details of the ICICI bank account meant for the same are as follows:</li>
</ol>
<strong> You can send the details of your transaction to this email ID: fin.mithostels@manipal.edu</strong>

&nbsp;
<ol start="3">
	<li><strong>SBI Collect:  </strong> Hostel and Mess Fees can also be paid through the iCollect Facility. We confirmed it from the Accounts section and it is similar to the process of payment of Tuition Fees. Hostel Fees can be paid through SBI Collect. More details under the ‘Tuition Fees’ section of the manipal.edu website.</li>
</ol>
&nbsp;
