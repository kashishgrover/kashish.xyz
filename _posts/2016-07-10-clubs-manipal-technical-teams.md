Just outside the KC gate is a compound that houses an unassuming cluster of buildings that most people pass by without a second glance. Yet, every evening from the time classes end until late into the night, some of the most intelligent, talented, dedicated and passionate students of MIT gather here to accomplish feats of engineering that the rest of us only dream of. These are the people to whom engineering is not just a bunch of classes or an abstract concept but the work that they do every single day. Here is the list of the major technical teams of MIT and what each of them does.

<strong>FORMULA MANIPAL</strong>

<a href="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/formula-manipal.jpg" xlink="href"><img class="wp-image-3109 alignright" src="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/formula-manipal.jpg" alt="formula manipal" width="382" height="132" /></a>

Formula Manipal is a student engineering project based in MIT. It is a team of students who aim to design, conceptualize, fabricate, test and race a single seater, open-wheel Formula Style race car. Since its first competition in 2008, the team has participated in competitions in Italy, UK, Austria, Germany and the Czech Republic and in 2016, will be participating in Formula Student Germany.

Their initial achievements included the ‘Farthest Travelled Team award’ (2008 Italy), ‘Fastest Indian FSAE car’ (2013 Germany). FMX4, the season 2014 car scaled new heights at the Formula Student India 2015 winning seven trophies and two national records in all after a commendable performances in the Formula Student Germany and Formula Student Czech Republic 2014.  Recently, the group topped the Formula Bharat 2017 Rulebook quiz.
Currently, the season 2016 team is working in the next car, where they seek to push the limits like never before. Apart from these awards, the cars have also been commended by big names from the world of automotive and racing, such as Claude Rouelle and Michael Royce. Having so much to match up to, the team is looking forward to an exciting season, hoping to carry on the legacy of Formula Manipal with their tagline <em>‘Engineered with Passion’.

<strong>TEAM MANIPAL RACING<a href="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/tmr.jpg" xlink="href"><img class="wp-image-3110 alignright" src="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/tmr.jpg" alt="tmr" width="354" height="131" /></a></strong>

Team Manipal Racing is Manipal University’s official off-road racing team. They are involved in designing, fabricating and testing their all-terrain vehicle. It is a 25-member student team without any external support from faculty or industry experts with a vision to expand the ATV culture across the country and develop their prototype to face real time situations like agriculture, defence, and medicine and rescue operations. The team participates in national events wherein they compete with over 200 college teams.

Their 2016-2017 season is currently underway. V7 is the latest version of their ATV which incorporates technologies that they have improved and improvised on since the first version of their car, V1, dating back to 2008. The team represented MIT in Baja Student India (Buddh International Circuit, New Delhi) &amp; Baja SAE India (NATRAX, Indore). Team Manipal Racing was one of the top contenders in New Delhi which fetched them a seeded entry for this season’s event. They also were the fifth fastest car in the competition, held 2nd in the Sales Event and 6th in the Cost Event.

<strong>PARIKSHIT<a href="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/parikshit.jpg" xlink="href"><img class="wp-image-3111 alignright" src="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/parikshit.jpg" alt="parikshit" width="365" height="135" /></a></strong>

The Parikshit Student Satellite Team is a group of around 40 engineering students from various branches with a common goal: to build a fully functional nano-satellite to be launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) on-board their Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV). Parikshit has two scientific missions going into space. The primary payload is a thermal imaging camera which will be taking thermal images of the Indian sub-continent for monitoring Urban Heat Islands (UHI’s) and Ocean surface temperatures. The secondary payload involves an Electo-Dynamic Tether for de-orbiting the satellite after the end of its lifetime to help reduce space-debris in the Low Earth Orbit (LEO). This will be the first of its kind payload to be successfully tested on-board a nano-satellite. The team has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with ISRO to support the design, development and launch of their satellite. The students frequently visit the ISRO Satellite Centre (ISAC) and other facilities for testing and verification of their work by distinguished scientists.

To join Parikshit, one only needs to be conceptually strong, willing to work hard and be dedicated to the project. The team is divided into six technical sub-systems and a management sub-system. The students constantly track other satellites and decode their beacon data. The team has also entered into a collaboration with Saber Astronautics, an Australian space company, for the design of the secondary payload. The team is frequently visited by many dignitaries for talks and discussions and has multiple industrial collaborations. The members of the team have published more than 40 technical papers and have been to international conferences like the “IEEE Aerospace Conference” and the “International Astronautical Congress”.

<strong>SOLARMOBIL</strong>

SolarMobil since its inception in 2011, has constantly been working towards achieving its one dream:  to fabricate a high performance cruiser class solar car and at the same time focus on the practical feasibility of the vehicle for daily use.  With the motto of “Imagineering the future”, the team focuses on cost effective, innovative and efficient ways of building a green future. The team comprises students from different fields of engineering working relentlessly towards designing an electric passenger solar car. They have successfully designed and manufactured two solar cars namely FREYR-1 and Serve, and are working on the third one at present. With FREYR-1, SolarMobil became one of the three teams in India to completely design and fabricate a solar car from scratch. Serve bagged the First Prize at Ujjwal, IIT Mumbai’s TechFest.
