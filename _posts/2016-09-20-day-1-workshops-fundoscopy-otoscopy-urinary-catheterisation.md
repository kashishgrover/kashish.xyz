Cutting edge members from 7<sup>th</sup> semester took charge of the fundoscopy, otoscopy and urinary catheterization workshop. After an initial briefing that started at 9.30 am, the students were divided into four groups and they took turns learning to catheterize the bladder in male and female dummies, and to use ophthalmoscopes and otoscopes. An IGCLA organizer revealed how he himself found a great learning opportunity in this workshop, even as he used it to his maximum advantage and imbibed a few skills himself. Attended by around forty stydents, the workshop ended around 12 noon with the students satisfied in having assimilated the important clinical skills taught.
