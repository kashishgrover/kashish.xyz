Echocardiography, is an imaging study of the heart, where ultrasonic waves are used to detect structural or functional abnormalities in the working of the heart. This fascinating technique and its interpretation was made easy for students by Dr. Krishnananda Nayak, SOAHS. He also tipped the students on how to read the ECG, an essential chart unfortunately not properly taught in any of the first three years of medical school. The enthusiastic students benefitted largely as they learnt about the various changes they could visualize in the Echocardiogram, in different abnormalities of the heart. The participants were then taken to see an echocardiography in progress. Hence, this was another successful workshop, another feather in the IGCLA hat.
