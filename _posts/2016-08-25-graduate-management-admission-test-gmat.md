The strategy you choose to adopt for preparation is very important.

After completing his B.Tech in 2015, Electrical and Electronics engineer, <strong>Anubhav Shrivastava</strong>, alumnus of Manipal Institute of Technology, successfully cleared GMAT and is now pursuing his studies in Indian School of Business (ISB). He shares with us, his take on the same.

<em>“It's a taxing exam. Having been educated as per the Indian system, you are supposed to be better at the Quantitative section than others, by default. So naturally, the focus in preparation should be more on verbal and if it's not your forte, then you will have a tough time because GMAT English is considered tougher than CAT English. Reading rigorously dense material daily is one habit that you need to develop to crack verbal.”</em>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Duration of Exam:</strong></li>
</ul>
The duration of the exam is 210 minutes, i.e. 3 hours and 30 minutes.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Selection procedure:</strong></li>
</ul>
<ol>
 	<li>The candidate gets his/her score immediately after completion of the test.</li>
 	<li>The score is valid upto 5 years after taking the test.</li>
 	<li>The GMAC shortlists worthy candidates for admission to various management courses in different institutes, on the basis of their GMAT score.</li>
 	<li>After getting shortlisted, the final selection of the applicant is made on the basis of several rounds of selection process such as Letters of Recommendation, Statement of Purpose, Personal Interview and/or other rounds held by different Business Schools.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Top Universities / Colleges in India and Abroad:</strong><strong> </strong></li>
</ul>
<em>“In India, I would name IBM (Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Calcutta, primarily), ISB, XLRI, FMS, SP Jain.</em>

<em>Abroad, there are many. All the top 25 B-schools ranked by financial times fall under the list. Depends on your priority. Different B-schools weigh differently in terms of ROI, brand name, industry exposure, curriculum, duration of study, etc.”</em>

<strong>On clearing the written exam, how should students prepare/groom themselves for the interviews? How does the preparation for the personal interview differ from that for the written exam?</strong>

<em>“Well, hone your communication skills. Improve your profile, and your college CGPA will also play a substantial role in getting a convert. When it comes to tier 1 B-schools. You are already in the backseat if your GPA is less than 8. Because an 8.5 or 9 CGPA in Manipal is the IIT/BITS equivalent of 7. Having said that, an average GPA doesn't rule you out of the game totally. It just makes it a bit more challenging.</em>

<em>Above all, communication skills and the ability to convince the interviewer of your competence for the college are very important. Your Curriculum Vitae (CV)</em>, <em>extracurriculars, academics, and your ability to deal with stress are assessed critically; don’t be nervous, stress is what interviewers feed on.”</em>

<strong>What are means do you suggest to prepare for the written exam and the interview?</strong>

<em>“Self study and lot of research (from the internet) for interview preparation. I also spoke to some of the almuni of ISB.”</em>

<em>
</em><strong>Could you avail these from Manipal?</strong>

<em>“No. Personally, I do not endorse coaching for GMAT. But yes, there are a couple of Manipal seniors who are in ISB. So you can always contact us in that regard.”</em>

<em>
</em><strong>Do you suggest any online references/sources for preparation?</strong><strong>
</strong><em>“GMATCLUB, Manhattan Guides, Aristotle SC, Aristotle Powerscore Bible, Kaplan Verbal Workbook, etc.”</em>
