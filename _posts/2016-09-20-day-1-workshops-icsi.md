One of the many workshops hosted by the IGCLA committee was on Intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) conducted at the Department of Clinical Embryology, Central research lab from 9.00am to 11.30am. The delegates were briefed on methods of semen analysis, cryopreservation and ICSI, followed by their demonstration. Semen analysis involves techniques to obtain the viable sperms (male gametes) and cryopreservation is used to store these for a longer duration. The ICSI procedure demands high precision and practice. The students were fascinated by the inverted microscope and micromanipulators that were used to inject the sperm into the oocyte (female gamete), and tried their hands at the same. With such advancement in science and technology, assisted reproductive technique is indeed a big boon to many wishful parents in our society.
