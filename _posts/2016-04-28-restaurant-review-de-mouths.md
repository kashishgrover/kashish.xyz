<strong><em>The experience:</em></strong>

A haven for those with a sweet tooth, De Mouths is a tiny ice cream parlor located in an easy-to-miss spot near AB5. The place exclusively serves Cream Bell ice creams, cold coffee, milkshakes, granitas, mojitos and lemonades. The ice cream sandwich is a specialty of Cream Bell and is truly addictive (from experience). They also make their own fresh cones! The milkshakes come with a scoop of ice cream and are heavenly. For an invigorating kick, the mojitos are a must-try. However, sometimes the mint syrup tends to overpower the flavor of the mojito so they are best avoided if one dislikes the taste of mint.

It has a very congested seating area (seats around 10 people) and tends to get pretty crowded in the evening. Pop music plays in the background making the experience quite pleasant despite the lack of any effort on their part in the context of aesthetics. Service is very prompt and everything is prepared in full view of the customer.
