<blockquote>We’ve seen the posters and heard the rumours. It’s all true. Sunburn Campus is finally coming to Manipal.</blockquote>
&nbsp;

On the 6<sup>th</sup> of February, the AB1 quadrangle will be set ablaze with lights and sounds, fueled by the dripping enthusiasm of the students who’ve come to experience the ultimate EDM fest in the continent – Sunburn.

For those who don’t know, Sunburn is Asia’s largest premiere Electro Dance Music festival and it’s being brought to Manipal (in the form of Sunburn Campus) by Red X. Continually ranked as the best live experience fest in Asia, Sunburn has made a mark both in India and internationally.

Hailing from Bangalore and having performed at Sunburn Goa, Rohan Kapoor has shared the stage with Hardwell, Afrojack and Blasterjaxx. DJ Axonn, also from Bangalore has performed with several renowned artists such as Anish Sood and Lost Stories. He is also an alumnus of MIT.

DJ Sartek, the highlight of the event, is the first DJ in India to be signed by the label Cloud9Music.

The show will start at 6.30pm on the 6th of February. Students are expected to carry their college ID cards along with their tickets to enter the premises.

Sunburn Campus is organized by the Disha wing of Red X Manipal - the official socio-adventure club of Manipal University. Disha, the social wing, aims to provide underprivileged children by teaching them, hosting workshops, raising funds and building infrastructure in schools and orphanages in and around Manipal.
