Almost a year back, The Chicken Bay opened its doors in Manipal with the aim to serve delicious as well as affordable food (I'd say they've succeeded at that - they're said to have the best fries in town). It has 4 outlets - one being in Manipal, one in Mangalore and two others. They also plan to expand abroad in a few years.

<a href="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG-20160507-WA0004.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2548" src="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/IMG-20160507-WA0004-1024x751.jpg" alt="IMG-20160507-WA0004" width="1024" height="751" /></a>

The place is divided into two air-conditioned seating areas with ample space. The menu, though not vast, offers a good number of choices for the meat-lovers but is a little scant in choices for those who prefer sticking to their veggies. The grilled chicken is succulent and has a perfect balance of various spices. Even something as basic as french fries has a very interesting seasoning which leaves one craving for more. However, their fries may also be customized to suit any end of the spectrum – From catering to those with a spice craving to those who detest anything but a pinch of salt in their fries. The saffron rice has some delicious flavours to it along with the beautiful smell and colour of saffron, although the pop chick that comes with it was a little hard to be palatable.

While ordering, they offer free samples so that one may order something only if they like it. Service is a major priority for them because of which they refuse to tie up with any online food portal for orders and deliveries, instead they stick to the old-fashioned but more personal way of calling to order which ensures a more customized experience as per the customers’ needs.

Note: They do charge a nominal tax on the billed amount (which is highly affordable).
