The glamourous models, breathtaking outfits and fitting music was preluded by a story of Revels; how the event got its true name and went on to become one of the most awaited sports and cultural fest of Manipal. The fashion show, however, was one that far superseded everybody’s expectations. The excitement of the quadrangle made up for the nonchalant expressions of the artists walking the ramp. The sheer number of spectators invigorated the already electrifying feel of Revels.
The Fashion Show of Revels 2016 was very different in comparison to the everyday fashion shows we are habituated to seeing. This time, participants had to concoct a story of their own, and portray it through the use of dazzling outfits and routines. The lights, music and outfits blended together to create the perfect atmosphere; one that ended up making even the ‘non fashion mongers’ attend the event.
The aura created by the very poignant introduction was carried on by the first performance of the event. The first team very beautifully re-enacted the love story of Bajirao Mastaani, one full of lust and languish, although ridden with grief and sacrifice. Even though the 18th century love story did not quite match with the background track ‘How deep is your love’, the very well-tailored outfits made up for any error in song choice.

The second performance was one that was the story of Maleficent, a kind-hearted fairy, who is deceived by the love of her life, Stefan. Soon, she places a curse on his daughter, Aurora, in order to sate her thirst for justice. The very well thought out ramp walk was one that saw artists in fairy costumes of white and blue velveteen cloth. The entrancing story coupled with fitting outfits made this performance a very memorable one.
The third group of artists brought forward a very important message for all of us: the issue of physical violence by intimate partners. Other notable performances were centered on an array of topics as antiquated as the Mahabharata and as phantasmal as a snow land.
Another performance that left everyone in the audience heart felt was performed by artists of MIT, Manipal. With the accompaniment of lavish attire and confident strides, the artists concocted a love story; not just one, but five different ones. Love is something that helps us achieve the impossible; it’s something that binds us when we’re falling to pieces, and cures us when we’re unbalanced. The artists showed us a completely new dimension to love – one that will remain etched in our memory for a long time.<a href="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/hautecouture4.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-1413"><img class=" wp-image-1413 aligncenter" src="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/hautecouture4.jpg" alt="hautecouture4" width="511" height="766" /></a>
The penultimate performance depicted the story of Alice in Wonderland. The intricacies which this group delved into made the all-inclusive portrayal of their theme full of vigor and zeal. The sheer exuberance with which the artists panned out the wonderland of their fantasies bewildered the judges and the audiences alike.
That being said, the Haute Couture was an event that embraced the creativity aspect that many of us lack today. It not only showcased some very beautifully tailored outfits, but put forward a plethora of tales and messages.
