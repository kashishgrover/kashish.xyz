In a world that is recently experiencing a so called ‘Digital Boom’, where start-ups have become a very common entity, students usually get caught up in a dilemma as to how the entire idea takes shape in subsequent years. This summit catered to those inquisitive and eager students who just might turn into an entrepreneur someday.

The 5 panel discussions were infused with wit and humour, and each person on the panel shared his part of the story behind establishing a start-up. They amalgamated their inspiring speeches with various anecdotes, stories of inspiration, sudden opportunities, relentless perseverance, repeated failures, and how all these together reaped a huge success. The main ideology that they wanted the students to grasp and imbibe was to love what they did, and be inspired by life. The joy of creating something new should be their fuel, and students should look past materialistic milestones in order to create that ‘perfect product’. The Q&amp;A session was filled with questions from the ever curious and enthusiastic crowd, which were answered with great care by the panelists.

The event plunged into both the technical and financial aspects. Specific emphasis was given on whether to sketch out a Plan A and Plan B - higher education before start-ups, following gut instincts, quality of production, and various do’s and don’ts of the start-up industry.  The panel discussion provided the immensely important idea about the monetary aspects of a start-up, and made the students aware about how to look for investors, convince them, and always take informed decisions. For a more authentic perspective on this topic, angel investor G Ram Chaitanya Reddy guided the students through the various vistas of the financial basics of today’s world.
