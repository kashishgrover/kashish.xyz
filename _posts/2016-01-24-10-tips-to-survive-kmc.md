<strong>1)      </strong><strong>ATTENDANCE</strong>

The one word which is dreaded by all and is the ultimate nemesis of all those who like to enjoy a good morning sleep. “75%” looms large in the minds of all KMC students all through their four and a half year tenure. So, freshers remember that KMC is EXTREMELY strict about attendance. So better be safe than sorry and don’t bunk more classes than what is necessary.

&nbsp;

<strong>2)      </strong><strong>RAINS</strong>

Manipal and rain. These are two words which go hand in hand. Manipal is the Rain God’s favourite toy. He likes to fiddle with it and “shower” his blessings on the student town whenever he realizes people have stepped out without umbrellas. Everyone (and I mean everyone) who has lived in Manipal has been trolled by the weather atleast once. So NEVER (I repeat NEVER) leave your rooms without an umbrella especially during July-October. Also, forget leather. Rubber shoes is the way to go about in these months.

&nbsp;

<strong>3)      </strong><strong>SENIORS</strong>

These are the people who have been there and done that. Your seniors at KMC are the ones who know everything starting from what to study to where to get the good food. They are extremely approachable and KMC can boast of a good rapport between juniors and seniors. So feel free to befriend your seniors without worrying about getting ragged.

&nbsp;

<strong>4)      </strong><strong>EXTRA-</strong><b>CURRICULAR</b>

KMC is one of the best examples of the fact that doctors don’t only study. KMC has a number of number of fests lined up all year long. Vibes, Verve, Utsav, Mist and Flava are great opportunities to nurture one’s talents and discover new ones. So go ahead and participate in the wide array of events that KMC has to offer.

&nbsp;

<strong>5)      </strong><strong>BACKLOGS</strong>

Yes, med school students have to study. Infact, they have to study A LOT. But, careful planning and systematic study is the key to surviving in KMC. The ideal way to balance extra-curricular and study is not to keep backlogs. Do not let portions pile up till the end.

&nbsp;

<strong>6)      </strong><strong>CURFEW</strong>

Unlike many other colleges in Manipal, KMC is blessed to have late curfew timings. However hostels are extremely strict about breaking curfew. So remember that 23:59 and 00:01 make a huge difference to the hostel security guards.

&nbsp;

<strong>7)      </strong><strong>FOOD</strong>

Forget high-priced inedible mess food. If you want your food to be at least a faint reminder of “<em>ghar ka khana</em>” try the local messes which deliver food at your doorstep. For the foodies who want a proper gastronomic experience and don’t mind a bit of a pocket pinch, Manipal boasts of good fine dining restaurants too! So go ahead and pamper your tastebuds.

&nbsp;

<strong>8)      </strong><strong>MUST-VISITS</strong>

Being in Manipal provides you with the opportunity to explore Karnataka and other parts of South India. So take a trip to Kudremukh or chill out in Goa for a weekend. Because nothing can be more fun than a college trip with buddies.

&nbsp;

<strong>9)      </strong><strong>CROWS</strong>

Food lovers in Manipal BEWARE! These scavengers will come unnoticed just when you are going to take a bite of your favourite puff or sandwich before you can even take a bite. So guard your food at all time when you are enjoying a quick snack at Shenoy’s.

&nbsp;

<strong>10)  </strong><strong>FUNGUS</strong>

Along with rains in Manipal comes its partner-in-crime – FUNGUS. So if you want to protect your favourite Gucci dress or Aldo shoes from them, keep naphthalene balls in your wardrobe at all times.
