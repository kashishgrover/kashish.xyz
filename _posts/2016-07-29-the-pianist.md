<strong><em>Over the keys her fingers flew
She knew this is nothing new.
Joy was what she felt,
And their hearts did melt,
When she played the songs she knew.

The keys moved up and down
Black and white sitting on golden brown.
Happiness was what she felt,
And their hearts did melt,
The queen of music was crowned.

Scales and arpeggios, she knew them all
Her repertoire was a rich haul.
Ecstasy was what she felt,
And their hearts did melt,
Not a moment more did she stall.

She played her heart out
The spectators did cheer and shout.
A rush of adrenaline was what she felt,
And their hearts did melt,
Her piece ended and there was a drought.

Life was what the piano gave
For nothing else did she crave.
Contentment was what she felt,
The cards of satisfaction were dealt,
And the road to greatness was paved.
