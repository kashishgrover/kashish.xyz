Inborn errors of metabolism are a set of easily misdiagnosed diseases possessing a plethora of symptoms that have notoriously avoided the public gaze until recent times. Drawing a statistical parallel from the visits he saw during his stay in Hannover at a facility dedicated to pediatric metabolic disorders, Dr. Partha Dabke surmised that a significant part of the population may persist without realizing the exact nature of their condition.

He shared his experience of designing an app to assist in such diagnoses, which takes input based on patient history and provides a probable metabolic error to account for the same. While there is still a long way to go, he expressed his sincere desire that his MitoApp could be a brick paving the path to a future of efficient and economical healthcare for patients suffering from IEM's.
