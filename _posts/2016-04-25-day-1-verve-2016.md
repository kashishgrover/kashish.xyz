The battlefield was all set and the warriors equally bubbling with enthusiasm (showing total indifference to the sultry weather). Thus began, 'Verve 2016' with the customary headcount at the library and the second semester students heavily out-numbering those from the rest of the semesters. Then they marched all the way from the library to KMC Greens where Dr. Rajgopal Shenoy (Associate Dean) officially declared KMC’s very own annual inter-semester fest open. The theme for Verve this year was “A Game of Cards”, with each of the four semesters representing the suits – clubs, diamonds, hearts, and spades. The occasion was followed by an inter-semester tug-of-war (won by the 6<sup>th</sup> semester students) and a lovely event – the ASARE Evening, organized by the Social Welfare Committee. The dance performance to a medley of peppy Bollywood songs by the mentally challenged students of ASARE was heartwarming and inspiring.

STREET PLAY

Verve 2016 kicked off in style with the street play, the first competitive event of the fest. The crowd witnessed some spectacular performances put up by different semesters of KMC, Manipal. The judges for the show were Dr. Chandni Gupta (Dept. of Anatomy), Dr. Arvind Kumar Pandey (Dept. of Anatomy) and Dr. Ashwini Kumar (Dept. of Forensic Medicine). It began with the 8<sup>th</sup> semester students presenting a play on ‘Sanitation in India’. They gave a musical performance throwing light upon the ‘Swachh Bharat’ initiative and the need for clean public toilets for women. Next up was a show on ‘Moral Police’ by the 6<sup>th</sup> semester highlighting the corrupt practices of policemen, followed by the 4<sup>th</sup> semester students bringing up the issue on ‘Culture and its role in upbringing of citizens’. Last but certainly not the least, the 2<sup>nd</sup> semester students put up a great show addressing the issue of ‘Malpractice by Indian Doctors’. They depicted how corrupt doctors indulge in female foeticide and organ harvesting. They showed how doctors, under the influence Medical Representatives (MRs) of various pharmaceutical firms, hoodwink patients and prescribe expensive medicines and useless tests. To end with, they entrusted the future of Indian medicine to medical students who must “live to serve” and must “serve before self”.

<strong>Winners:</strong>

1<sup>st </sup>: 2<sup>nd</sup> semester

2<sup>nd </sup>: 8<sup>th</sup> semester

3<sup>rd</sup>: 6<sup>th</sup> semester

SPOT PHOTOGRAPHY

The Spot Photography event in Verve ’16 probably granted the participants’ maximum flexibility and space to showcase what they want to. In this event, the participants have been given two days and in these two days, the participants have to photograph on the theme “Life is a gamble.”

Winners to be announced later.

CARTOONING

The next event of Verve ’16 was Cartooning. Having taken place in the Pharmacology Lecture Hall, the event saw a participation of six people and was judged by Dr Swapna (Department of Pharmacology) and Dr Abhyu (Intern). This event brought out talent that one would generally not associate with a medical student. The theme for this year’s event was “Ladies Compartment.” Each participant made a creative and original cartoon/comic strip within an hour and a half.

<strong>Winners:</strong>

1<sup>st</sup> Place: Aarthi (2<sup>nd</sup> Semester)

JAM

It is easy to call JAM one of the most intriguing literary events. From hilarious pun-intended topics to cut-throat interjections, only does a quick witted banter to the mark of a minute wins it all. Needless to say, a fierce battle was fought between twelve contenders, six each in two sets. Ms. Anusha Venkatesh was the JAM master for the day, the rules being:

1 – JAM master is always right!

2 – Raising valid interjections namely spotting grammatical errors, stammering, pauses, dramatization, direct speech, use of personal pronouns, usage strict Queen’s English, standard format, repetition, tempo and speech defect.

INDIA QUIZ

Twisting turns of phrase, maddening mythology, and confounding connects mesmerized and tantalized the teams at the India Quiz competition. The amiable teams developed a quick rapport with the quizmasters, and created a very personal affair of the quiz. For a few hours well whiled away, the room became a haven for lovers of Indian lore albeit including well-paced rounds and a fierce sense of competition.

<strong>Winners:</strong>

1st: Shreya Mathur, Avinash G Rao, Ashish Rao M (2nd Semester)

2nd: Sumona Kundu, Namrata Reddy, Sailaja MN (8th Semester)

3rd: Omer Mujahid, Zaid Hussain, Mridul Mahajan (8th Semester)

&nbsp;

INSTRUMENTAL SOLO

The grass in the KMC Greens wafted with the breeze carrying soft tunes that rocked the heads of all listeners during the Instrumental Solo event. Gentle strings were plucked in a silence pregnant with bated breath, and dulcet sighs accompanied each deft fingerstroke skating across a keyboard. Music at its purest ran through the open meadow, and touched all hearts. The unenviable task of selecting the winner fell to Dr Chandni Gupta and Dr Balakrishnan R.

<strong>Winners:</strong>

1st: Jayaram Deepak (4th Semester)

2nd: Anurag GV (6th Semester)

3rd: Pranav Batra (4th Semester)

<strong> </strong>

EASTERN VOCAL SOLO

Verve is gathering its characteristic momentum. Before day one ended, there was a dusky musical evening to facilitate the crescendo. The event was held at KMC Greens at 6:30 pm. The judges were Dr. Ullas Kamath (Dean, MMMC), Dr. Murlidhar Pai (Dept. of OBG) and our very own seasoned singer Dr. Abhishek Rao (Dept. of Anesthesiology). The crowd was treated to an array of melody infused vocals, summing up an evening of eclectic music. The winners were:

INTER DEPARTMENTAL

The first day of Verve 2016 could not have ended on a more spectacular note. The last event was the Inter-Departmental competition which pitches the various departments at KMC Manipal against each other. The spectators had turned up in huge numbers and anticipation turned the air heavy. The very professors who teach us the principles of medicine, lit the stage on fire with music, and dance! Kudos to all the teachers who put up such a brilliant show!
