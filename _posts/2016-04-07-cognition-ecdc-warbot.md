Organised by IE E&amp;C Manipal, this was one of the most interesting technical fests of MIT. People of all years were encouraged to showcase their intelligence and innovative ideas. The fest included numerous events, such as Warbot, Techventure, Cybermatrix, Lasertron, etc. Here is our coverage of two of their main events:

&nbsp;

<strong>EC/DC- Practical Circuit Implementation Contest</strong>

<a href="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/c1-1.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-1934"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1934" src="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/c1-1.jpg" alt="c1" width="682" height="454" /></a>

If rigging a circuit and messing with it is your idea of having a blast, you couldn’t possibly have missed this event. EC/DC was a two round event which tested the participant’s ability to understand the basic electronic circuits.

The first round was a paper-pen Q&amp;A round held in NLH. The paper had questions based on fundamental knowledge of basic electronics. Each team having a minimum of two personnel, had to work together and figure out the solutions to the respective questions. The first round was solely judged based on the answers of the participants and were then notified if they were through to the second round. Almost the half the teams that were present in the first round got eliminated.

The second round was held at the biomedical lab in AB5. It was basically a practical assessment of their knowledge on the circuit theory and implementation. They were questions about analysing a given code in both the Excess-3 and BCD format of binary representation, and other application based questions about the given input waveforms. Basically everything that would make your average circuit geek jump in joy.

<strong>Warbot</strong>

<a href="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/c6-1.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-1938"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1938" src="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/c6-1.jpg" alt="c6" width="687" height="457" /></a>

The arena of Kamath Circle was transformed into a battlefield for this particular event, and not a soul walking towards the Food Court could have missed it. Like the name suggests, it involved robots sparring each other, until one of them won

. Each of the robots were required to have essential attacking and defensive features, enabling the superior robot to win during an oncoming combat. There were three rounds- The first one involved pushing the opponent’s robot out of the arena. The second one was essentially a race requiring the robot to traverse a particular path in the shortest time period.

<a href="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/c9.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-1940"><img class="alignnone wp-image-1940" src="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/c9.jpg" alt="c9" width="688" height="458" /></a>

In the final round various obstacles were placed in the arena and the fastest robots to throw them out would win. The audience cheered, jeered and laughed as the two finalists battled it out, seeing as one of the robots (having dumbbells) was clearly at an advantage. It was a raging success; both the participants and the audience enjoyed this event thoroughly.
