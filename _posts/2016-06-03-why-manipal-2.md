As the board exams and entrance exam results are released, there is only one thing every ex-12th grader is thinking about: “Which college should I join?” If you’re wondering whether Manipal should be on your list of colleges to consider, this article answers the questions that are probably on your minds right now.

<a href="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/m4-1.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2703" src="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/m4-1.png" alt="m4" width="660" height="288" /></a>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Academics</strong></span>
“Is the syllabus set here really very tough? I’ve studied in the CBSE board all my life and the whole idea of a private university-issued syllabus sounds scary."

Don’t worry! The syllabus of the first year of your engineering is pretty much like a more specialised version of your 12th standard syllabus. Also, the syllabus is set in a CBSE-competent theme so you’ll have no problem getting used to it.

“My rank is over one thousand. Can I still apply for any other scholarship(s)”?

Sure. There are a few other scholarship schemes associated with MU other than the merit-cum-means scholarships, like the AICTE and a few others that are branch or person specific which you can find put by visiting <a href="http://www.manipal.edu">the university website</a>, or by asking the officials associated with that branch of study in the college.

<a href="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG-20160405-WA0019.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-1873" src="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/IMG-20160405-WA0019-1024x576.jpg" alt="The identical twin blocks 14th and 15th" width="1024" height="576" /></a>

“What if I want to study/do part of my studying abroad?”

ICAS is a twinning program that allows you to spend two years in Manipal and two years in partner universities all over the globe. On completion you will receive a degree from the foreign university.
There are also organisations in the college (AIESEC and IAESTE) that help you obtain internships abroad.

<a href="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/RC.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2823" src="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/RC.jpg" alt="RC" width="960" height="347" /></a>

“Do we get any choice in what we study or are we stuck to a fixed curriculum?”

Over the four years you can take two open electives and six program electives. Open electives (which are offered in the fourth semester and the sixth semester) are courses that you choose outside your department. You can study a course from any one of the other engineering streams, the humanities department or the science and math departments. The sixth semester open elective can also be at a different college under the university. You can see the list of open electives offered last year <a href="http://manipalthetalk.net/colleges/mit/open-elective-2014-2018-fourth-sem/" target="_blank">here</a> and here. The program electives are courses that you choose from within your own department. They allow you to focus on areas of your branch that interest you more. You can also obtain a minor specialization by choosing four courses in the same field.

<a href="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IMG_2922-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2834" src="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/IMG_2922-2-1024x515.jpg" alt="IMG_2922-2" width="1024" height="515" /></a>

MIT is also in the process of introducing the option of having majors and minors, just like most international curricula have. For those who have not heard of this, it means that you can major in a particular department (for eg. mechanical engineering) and also have a minor in a different department (like political science, or history). This is going to be a really amazing change, as it will help us to achieve a more multidisciplinary approach to our education and a more diverse outlook towards our own careers.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Lifestyle</strong></span>
“I’ve registered for an engineering course at MIT, Manipal and I’ve never really been to south India before. I’ve heard that it gets really hot there. How is the weather in Manipal throughout the year”?

Since the college is located in proximity to the Western Ghats, you will experience some extreme monsoons in the odd semesters. The temperature here ranges from 26-40 degree Celsius. The even semesters however, will be a little windy and mostly humid, but less hot and sticky in comparison to other parts of the state. With many scenic spots and pretty beaches close by, you will find more reasons to spend your bright evenings here making some memorable moments with your new friends.

<a href="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Holipal.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2826" src="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Holipal.jpg" alt="Holipal" width="960" height="640" /></a>

“I’m from Mumbai/Chennai/Bangalore/Delhi/Hyderabad/Kolkata and I’m used to having all the amenities a big city offers. I’ve heard Manipal is a small town. Does that mean giving up easy access to all the shopping and restaurants I’m used to? If I leave something important at home, will I have trouble finding it in Manipal?”

Not at all! Manipal is a small town, true, but it is a campus town. This means that most of the town’s facilities are designed to cater to students. It has a KFC, Domino’s, Pizza Hut, Café Coffee Day and a ton of other restaurants that have excellent food. Some of them have been reviewed by us.. It has an INOX which features most of the major English and Hindi movies along with the local Kannada ones. There are departmental stores that stock almost anything you might possibly need, clothing stores (such as Reliance Trends), bookstores and gift stores. There are lots of salons (including a ‘Naturals’ parlour) and gaming places too.

<a href="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/KGP_3446-copy.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-448" src="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/KGP_3446-copy-1024x683.jpg" alt="KGP copy" width="1024" height="683" /></a>

The best part is that because it’s a small town, all these places are never more than ten minutes away. Even if there’s something that Manipal can’t provide, most online sellers (Flipkart, Amazon, Jabong, etc) deliver quickly to Manipal. The much larger town of Udupi is only a five minute bus ride away and has plenty more stores and a Big Bazaar. If a mall is what you’re looking for, Mangalore is only around 90 minutes away by bus and has two decently sized malls to fulfil your shopping needs.

“I don’t like spending too much time indoors and I usually go out a lot with my friends while at home. Will staying in a hostel mean that I will be restricted from going outside?”

Manipal is a very safe town and the hostel curfew reflects it. In the MIT hostels which also house MIC, Architecture, and DoC students, first years have to return by 9:30 pm. The senior girls have a curfew of 10:30 and the senior boys have a curfew of 11. As long as you return to the hostel before the curfew, you can come and go from the hostel as you wish. You have plenty of freedom to go around in Manipal and to take day trips to nearby places.

“What is the general mind-set of the students in the college? I want to know if I’ll be able to connect with my peers.”

While it’s not good to generalise too much or stereotype, it’s safe to say that students in Manipal are open minded and laid back. This is not a campus where you will find political or religious divides. You’re more likely to hear an argument about Apple vs Android (with background commentary from a pedant who insists that it’s iOS vs Android, not Apple since Apple is a company and Android is an operating system) than a debate about BJP vs Congress.

“I have to admit that I like the luxuries of home. I’ve heard horror stories about living in hostels and eating in college messes. What are the facilities like in Manipal?

<a href="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/10580956_1170495032961740_2082566957751725246_o.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1469" src="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/10580956_1170495032961740_2082566957751725246_o-1024x678.jpg" alt="TheLocalTrain@Revels" width="1024" height="678" /></a>

Moving to a hostel for the first time is always difficult. The homesickness, learning to adjust with a roommate and the responsibility of living on your own are all difficulties that need to be overcome. However, in Manipal, the hostel rooms are well-maintained, spacious and comfortable. You can check out the list of hostels available for freshers here and here. The mess food is of a decent quality though it does get boring after some time.

<a href="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/DesiTadka-22.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1441" src="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/DesiTadka-22.jpg" alt="DesiTadka" width="1005" height="547" /></a>

“I’ve never lived on my own before and I’m scared to move so far away from home. How will I manage without the support system of my family and friends?”

The college has a Student Mentorship Program that can pair you with a senior student who will act as a mentor and help you settle in. The main objectives of this program are:
1. To make the placement process better by involving the alumni extensively for references and mentorship.
2. To help the students decide their course of action early on through effective mentoring.
3. To completely eradicate ragging and reduce social alienation.
4. To make the environment conducive for ideation.
Apart from this, you will also be assigned a teacher guardian whom you can approach for any problems you may face while in college.

<strong>Projects and other College activities</strong>
“I’ve been doing a lot of extra-curricular activities in school. Will I be able to continue these in Manipal?”

MIT has a lot of student clubs to help you continue with your hobbies. Whether your interest lies in drama, sports, quizzing, astronomy or photography, you’ll find a club in Manipal that caters to you. There are also clubs that perform social service and technical clubs for every branch. Most of the clubs conduct regular activities and send students to participate in various college fests around the country.

<a href="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Lake.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2821" src="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Lake.jpg" alt="Lake" width="960" height="625" /></a>

“I’ve heard tons about how amazing college fests can get in engineering colleges, from my siblings. How are the scenes in Manipal during fests”?

You’ve heard that right! MIT has two annual fests: Tech Tatva and Revels which are the technical and cultural fest of the college, held in the odd and even semesters respectively. In addition to Utsav, the university fest. You can not only participate but also organize and plan the fest. First years can be ‘volunteers’ for both fests and get a glimpse of what goes on behind the scenes. Most of the other colleges have their own fests that you can visit too. KMC has Vibes and Verve for example.

<a href="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Rain.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2822" src="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Rain.jpg" alt="Rain" width="960" height="640" /></a>

The cultural fests usually end in a bang with renowned musicians and performers performing on the last day of the fest. We had Farhan Akhtar performing live at MIT in Revels ‘15. Revels ’16 saw not just one but six different visitors including The Local Train, Sorabh Pant and Nucleya. These festivals are a great time to bond and make new friends, with really challenging events and competitions that keep you on your toes, it is a great opportunity to flaunt your talents and polish your capabilities. If you want to see what the cultural fest looks like, you can get a good idea of it here:

“I’ve read all about the students groups like formula one and Solar Mobil at MIT that are achieving great new levels that are associated to MIT and I’ve always aspired to do something of that sort on my own. Will my ideas also get a platform of that sort”?

Why not? The university has great schemes that help upcoming student start-ups in their ventures. The Innovation Centre at MIT, Manipal also caters to the students’ curiosities by providing opportunities to work on projects sponsored by world renowned companies at the stat-of-the-art labs of the college. If your ideas are good enough to make the cut, your business plans will also take flight with a nurturing environment that has helped many before.

“I hear there’s a new director at MIT now. Has he made a lot of changes?”

We’ll let you in on a secret. Our new director is kind of really cool. He's one of the most open-minded people you could possibly find in Manipal. Let's say you have the idea for a cool new start-up, or perhaps a new college club? You can approach him directly, and rest assured that your work will be done. He is immensely understanding and loves to interact with us students, find out our grievances, etc. In short, we're really lucky to have him.
