In an interactive session, Dr. Vivek M Joshi delivered a speech on “Ligation of Internal Iliac Arteries”. His talk was brilliant, with audio-visual aids and videos showing C-Sections followed by the ligation of the internal iliac arteries. Though surprised that undergraduate students would have so many questions, he patiently answered the queries made by the audience.
