<span style="font-weight: 400">Deciding to shift out from the next semester, or perhaps this one? Has hostel life already bored you with its rules and restrictions? Are you looking for a flat outside the campus to stay at, in peace? If the answer to any of your questions is yes, then worry not. MTTN brings you a thorough knock-down of the various apartments in Manipal, along with all the info you need. Happy hunting!</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Mandavi Palace &amp; Mandavi Emerald</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">RENT: For 2BHK- 16K; For 3BHK- 24K. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">FLAT: Each apartment is incredulously spacious with large open living rooms and cosy bedrooms. Getting lucky with an apartment depends entirely on the owner as some refuse to provide necessities such as a fridge or even mattresses for the beds. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">DISTANCE FROM COLLEGE: it’s only 15 minutes away from MIT, if you prefer to walk to your class. If not, and auto will have you reach your class quite comfortably in under 2 minutes.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">SANITATION: Sanitation depends purely on the how caring your owner is about his/her apartment, as one tenant who contributed to this review was living with cockroaches for a few weeks before having to mercilessly exterminate them all. The laundry man occasionally drops by, though you'll be forced to pressure him in order for him to keep coming back for more.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">*Living in these apartments would normally require the need for a vehicle but due to unusual rules which tenants are required to sign when they move in, you'll not be allowed to park a vehicle in the given basement even if your apartment has been allocated a space.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">**Mandavi Emerald has a curfew time of 11pm, after which even visitors are not allowed inside.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Pavithra</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">RENT: its prime location does increase the rent a little. Most 2BHK flats are between 16-18k, 3BHK flats are 23-25k with a deposit of 40-50k and complete rent paid in advance. It’s one of the few Buildings that offers a 6 month lease to students.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">DISTANCE FROM COLLEGE: Pavitra's most enticing draw is its location. Standing tall on the other side of MIT, one can reach an early morning class in just two minutes (no exaggeration there).</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">FLAT: There is no denying that Pavithra is the ruler of the roost when it comes to apartments. The apartments are all well-furnished, and though perhaps not as glitzy as those of Ideal and Viridian, Pavithra has almost all the essentials.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">SANITATION: Laundry and maid services are present, and so are the standard options for Wi-Fi.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">*You have a plethora of restaurants (Shubham's, Vikram's, Zebra Spot, Northy Mess) all around which will keep hunger pangs satiated. And who can forget our beloved T-Spirits right in the next alley.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">**If you’re prone to waking up late, lazier than most aspiring engineers, perennially broke and wondering about your existence a lot these days, then Pavithra is the place for you.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Janta</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">RENT: Same as Pavithra, 2BHK for 16K and 3BHK for 24K.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">DISTANCE FROM COLLEGE: A step away from AB5, these apartments are ideal for the lazier ones of us. Classes can be reached in under 10 minutes.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">FLAT: These apartments are rather old but extremely comfortable. Janta is mostly like Pavithra, but has bigger apartments and is surrounded by thick foliage. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">SANITATION: Laundry and maid services are present, and so are the standard options for Wi-Fi.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">*Surrounded by restaurants (new ones opening continuously) one need never worry about the absence of the cook. Shopping can be done at a mart just 5 minutes away. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Ideal Residency</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">RENT: For 2BHK, 15K-17K; For 3BHK, 23-27K.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">FLAT: Located in a rather peaceful part of the town, these apartments offer you a delightful blend of affordability and luxury. Almost every room of every one of these apartments has a grand view of the lush rainforest adjacent to Eshwar Nagar. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">DISTANCE FROM COLLEGE: They're both a comfortable 8-10 minutes away from AB 5 on foot.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">SANITATION: Both buildings are fairly clean, although the occasional flat may have an insect problem. Maids are available for daily cleaning needs. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">*The buildings have fairly affordable internet plans of up to 4 Gbps provided by Airtel, NammaNet and BSNL with the option of achieving much higher speeds using cables. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>Regal Palacio &amp; Regal Hills</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">RENT: For 2BHK- 15K per month. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">FLAT: The apartments are pretty huge, with two washrooms each. Two people can stay very comfortably in these flats; however, the view is not that great.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">DISTANCE FROM COLLEGE: The buildings are situated right in front of AB5, saving a lot of potential auto money and time at the same time.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">SANITATION: A regular maid is available for day-to-day washing and cleaning. As for laundry, you either need to do it yourself or give it to the laundry guy, who isn’t exactly very punctual. Since the apartment isn't surrounded by jungle, the amount of creepy-crawlies are thankfully low.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">*The guards around here are pretty friendly, and will not make too much of a fuss over little instances.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Hi Point</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">RENT: The most positive thing about these apartments is the low rent. Around 10-12K for 2BHK and 15-17K for 3BHK. Usually, 3 people can stay comfortably in a 2BHK flat, and 4-5 people in a 3BHK.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">DISTANCE FROM COLLEGE: Though it seems to be situated rather far from the college, the actual distance is only around 1-1.5 kms. But since even this tends to scare off a lot of people, this place is Ideal with people with two-wheelers.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">FLAT: The flats are quite decent. The buildings are pretty new, though obviously not in the league or Ideal or Mandavi. The elevators work 24x7. Being kinda secluded, these apartments also provide you with the much-needed peace of mind.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">*One of the biggest disadvantages is that power backup is only available after 6pm. Also, there aren’t any grocery stores in close vicinity, making a personal vehicle all the more necessary.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Vijay Durga</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">RENT: Around 21K for each apartment, but 4 people can easily share the apartment. Electricity and Gas bills are very low, but may be high if you have a washing machine.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">DISTANCE FROM COLLEGE: It's just an 8 minute walk away from campus.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">FLAT: The apartments are brand new and have only been lived in barely once or twice. They are spacious and comfortable.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">SANITATION: Really good sanitation. The maid comes 3 days in a week, and you can also call the laundry guy or just pool in to buy a washing machine. One of the best things about these apartments is the absence of pests or insects of any kind.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">*Though the guards are pretty okay with most things, it’s better to bring your friends in by 9pm here.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Shambhavi</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">RENT: Most houses are 2BHK. Rent is around 14K for non-AC and 16K for AC apartments (kinda high due to proximity to college). Trump card: It has 4 penthouses (30k for 3BHK) complete with balconies having an amazing view.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">DISTANCE FROM COLLEGE: It’s only a 5 minute walk away from AB5. Even better, it’s really close to DeeTee. We all know which one you’re really interested in.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">FLAT: Pretty average rooms, nothing fancy. It comes equipped with most essential furniture. Slightly infamous for fights since people end up there after getting drunk at DeeTee. After midnight, elevators are stopped and no vehicles are allowed inside.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">SANITATION: Laundry and maid services are present.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">*Though it's a residential building, it actually gets commercial electricity from MESCOM so the electricity bill is usually pretty high.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Pragathi Pride</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">RENT: 24K for one flat, in which 3 people can live in very comfortably.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">DISTANCE FROM COLLEGE: It’s only a mere 2km from the main gate, or a 15-20 minute walk. Taking an auto is a far better option and will get you to class in 5 minutes.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">FLAT: The flats are pretty good, due to which a lot of families occupy apartments here too. The presence of an awesome pool is a major upside though.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">SANITATION: One major downside is the presence of cockroaches. It’s advised to get Pest Control done at the start of the semester.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">*Location of the building isn't that convenient, because any ATM is kinda far and there’s no place around to hang out at all. Therefore a personal vehicle is much needed here too.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Pratham Pride &amp; Pratham Abode</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">RENT: The flats in Pratham abode are massive and command a rent of around 24K for a 3BHK while the apartments at Pratham pride are rather cramped and cost around 18k for a 3BHK. Single apartments too are available.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">DISTANCE FROM COLLEGE: Situated above Crumbz Bakery, pretty far from the campus, it’s a great place to stay in as long as you do not mind driving/using public transport to get to class every morning and do not wake up at 8:10 for an 8 AM class.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">FLAT: With a location that caters to every section of society- from the self-proclaimed narcissist to the angst ridden introvert, Pratham Pride/Abode are ideal for those for whom walking to class isn't an absolute necessity. These apartments are famous for their abysmally low acceptance rate when it comes to MIT students. Internet connectivity is great, so is the water/electricity supply.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">SANITATION: Laundry and maid services are present.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">*The apartment is guarded by a single, mostly friendly guard posted on the only entrance. There are no restrictions on timings or number of visitors. The manager is rather warm and welcoming and actually very polite.</span>

&nbsp;

<b>Pratham Krishna</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">RENT: A 2BHK would cost around 14-18K a month while a 3BHK should be around 24K.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">DISTANCE FROM COLLEGE: Unlike Pride and Abode, Pratham Krishna is situated across the road near Remix. This makes it slightly inaccessible for those lacking any means of transport.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">FLAT: The flats are spacious and come equipped with a 24" LCD. The electricity/water supply is great but the internet connectivity is limited in terms of providers with namma net and ION being the chief ISPs present.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">SANITATION: Laundry and maid services are present.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">*Just like its more aged cousins -Pratham pride/abode, this apartment too comes with the freedom of unrestricted visiting hours and freedom of movement. The manager is rather enigmatic, the kind of guy you'd probably not talk to unless business is involved. </span>

&nbsp;

<b>MM Towers</b>

<span style="font-weight: 400">RENT: 16K for one flat, in which two people can stay comfortably.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">DISTANCE FROM COLLEGE: It’s around 1.5 kms away from the campus, or 40 bucks by Auto.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">FLAT: It's one of the cleanest places to stay in, and has really huge rooms too. The halls are a bit shady. Not many people live here.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">SANITATION: Pests like rodents and cockroaches are unheard of. There are, however, a lot of ants around.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400">*The guards are pretty chill, with no perm time at all. Sadly, the pool is not open for use.</span>
