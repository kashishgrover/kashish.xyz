If you’re a gamer, you know that when the insane rush of adrenaline kicks in, there’s no turning back. Being undoubtedly the center of attraction for the male population of MIT (who are quite a lot, in contrast to the insufficient number of available females- ahem), the gaming event was the perfect blend of energy, thrill and aggression. The number of erroneous bullets fired, goals missed, and cars crashed could only be accounted by the unhindered flow of (amusingly innovative) cusses and frustrated “Oh shits”. Neither could the cheers of victory be held back.
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_0053.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-1377"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-1377" src="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_0053-1024x683.jpg" alt="IMG_0053" width="658" height="439" /></a></p>
5 games, 4 rooms, 1 aim- to defeat and conquer. So engrossed were they in their laptop screens that no guy cared to give more than a fleeting glimpse to the only girl (me) sitting there (perhaps the only situation in which this makes sense). Due to the costlier delegate card fee, the number of people who participated were less than what was anticipated which caused a delay in the event’s commencement. That however, did not dampen the spirits of the organizers or the players. Sitting amid wires, headphones and laptops with typical Batman, Avengers and football club skins, the players awaited their turn in anticipation, their eyes transfixed on their screens. Here is a list of the various events that took place:

<a href="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_0063.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-1378"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1378" src="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_0063-1024x618.jpg" alt="IMG_0063" width="658" height="397" /></a>

FIFA 14/NFS-MW: Perhaps the most happening room on the floor, the football enthusiasts not only actively indulged in participation, but were on their seat’s edge during other matches too, as if spectators to a live football match. The sentiments attached to the game were clearly evident in the disappointed moans and triumphant shouts. Though Need for Speed- Most Wanted did not have many participants, the racer-blood in those few had them neck-to-neck with each other.

DOTA2: How do you prevent your players from getting bored when you know that your event is bound to start late? The correct answer to that is Whiplash. This event required two teams with 5 members each. Once the organizers realized that a few teams were going to arrive late, they put the projector to good use and played the movie Whiplash. What was all the more amusing, was the first match that followed. One of the teams got whip-lashed so terribly, they ended up forfeiting.

COD-MW3/CS: Call of Duty- Modern Warfare 3 and Counter Strike both consisted of 5-member teams. These first-person shooting games were rife with aggression, squabbles and invectives. With teams outrageously questioning the presence of certain members in their team and not being able to distinguish which players were the enemy, the scenario ended up looking quite hilarious.

The qualifiers of today’s round move to further rounds on subsequent days.
