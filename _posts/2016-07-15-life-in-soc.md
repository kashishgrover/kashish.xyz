You are probably at this juncture in your life where choosing a desirable college is perhaps harder than waiting for your 12 th standard result. And if you are planning to choose the Manipal School of Communication, you’ve taken a good decision! Let’s take a sneak peek into the life of students at the School of Communication, Manipal.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>History</strong></span>

Manipal School of Communication is the brainchild of Late Shri M V Kamath, who was a renowned journalist of his time. The college came into being with its aim of establishing an institution that would popularize the prospect of education in media. Started in 1997 with a postgraduate program, it soon after initiated its undergraduate program in the year 2001, which was in response to the phenomenal expansion of media equipped with the latest communication technology, to train competent skillful professionals who are equally sensitive to social values and public awareness.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Infrastructure</strong></span>

The college is located at about a distance of 200 meters from the main MIT Campus. The intake every year is about 120 students and they are usually divided into two separate divisions. The classrooms are well-ventilated, with greenery spreading all over the campus. Wi-Fi isn’t available in classrooms, but the library and the labs are well-equipped with them. The classrooms surround a beautiful quadrangle which is painted every year by students in accordance to the theme of the college every year revealed in the college fest, Article 19. On the first floor there is a computer laboratory which has computers that are equipped with all the Adobe and Microsoft Office Suites. The labs are neatly divided into UG (Undergraduate) and PG (Postgraduate) for a hassle-free conductance of classes. There is a sound recording studio within the heart of the college with lots of equipment which one can borrow once they sign a permission slip. The college also has its own private radio station, where students are taught the basics of radio as a media.

&nbsp;

The course is mainly theory based in the first half of the year and practical subjects are also introduced in the latter half.

The library is well stocked and you can find any book related to media and mass communication. The canteen has everything from samosas to Gobi Manchurian, and those of you who crave non vegetarian food (chicken puffs) and lime soda can walk a few feet away to the Akka’s shop right outside the gate.

The highlight of the college is the common room, which is a spacious, open area, built in a form of a concrete hut located right next to the canteen. Students conduct meetings throughout the year, and gatherings and other such events take place in the common room. The common room is also the consecutive hub for debates and discussion between students and faculty outside the restrictions of classrooms.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Academics</strong></span>

Most of the teachers are well versed in their subjects and quite knowledgeable in their respective fields.

Guest lectures are held from time to time, which are often beneficial to students for their course as well

as for general knowledge. The subjects for the first semester are as follows:

1) English Language &amp;amp; Literature-I

2) Human Communication and Presentation Skills

3) Reporting and Writing

4) Fundamentals of Internet &amp;amp; New Media

5) Modern World History

6) Environmental Science

<a href="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/image3.jpg" xlink="href"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-3288" src="http://manipalthetalk.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/image3-1024x683.jpg" alt="image3" width="1024" height="683" /></a>

The grading method is divided into a 50- 50 scheme (i.e. 50 marks for internals and 50 marks for externals). However a minimum score of 20 marks is required to pass the internal examination which is followed by the appearance in external examination. Internal examination is conducted in forms of creative assignments and tests throughout the semester. If a student fails the internals they will not be able to write the final Exam at the end of the semester and will have a back in that subject which can be cleared in the next semester or any semester of your choice by paying the required &amp; Re exam fees. A student acquires 4 credits per theory subject and practical subjects carry 2 credits. The minimum amount of credits required to pass the year are 24 credits. A mandatory of 75% attendance is required to be able to take the external examination.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Exchange Programs</strong></span>

The institute encourages students both undergraduate and graduate to study one semester in universities outside India. Students for these exchange programs are selected by a committee of faculty members that judges them based on their academic credentials, performance in co- curricular activities, adaptability to different cultures and other parameters. Few collaborations of the college are:

 Hochschule Bremen University of Applied Sciences, Bremen, Germany

 Hanze University of Applied Sciences, Groningen, The Netherlands

 University of Queensland, Australia

 Erasmus School of History, Erasmus University Rotterdam, The Netherlands

 Hogeschool Utrecht, Utrecht University of Applied Sciences, The Netherlands

 Aarhus University, Denmark.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Hostels &amp; Campus</strong></span>

SOC students are housed on the MIT side of the campus and it is mandatory for a first year student to live in the hostels unless they happen to be a local resident. First year girls have the options of 1 st , 2 nd , 11 th , 12th and the 21 st blocks whereas first year boys have the option of 18 th , 20 th , 5 th , 6 th and 17 th block. The time permitted for the first year students is 9:30 PM, after which if the student is found to be late, they’re asked to pay a fine and made to sign in late-coming register. The campus has everything a student would require within the vicinity of a kilometer, from campus stores located on the either sides of the campus to food centers like Snack Point and Kamath Canteen at Kamath Circle are pretty good for quick bites and a shawarma cart run by Dishes restaurant usually shows us outside the campus gates around 7:30. The main mess for the campus is the Food Court which is located at the Kamath Circle, and can house up to 10,000 students. The payment for the mess has to be made together with the payment of course fees. Certain hostels are equipped with their own personal messes as well. There is also a huge basketball court at KC. The presence of campus patrol in the campus prioritizes the safety of students. The most refreshing quality about Manipal is its immortal greenery, which stretches across every nook and corner of the campus, providing a healthy and pollution-free environment to students.
