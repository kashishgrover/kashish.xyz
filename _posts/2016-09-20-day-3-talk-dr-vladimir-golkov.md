The afternoon session began at 2:00 pm with a webinar conducted by Dr. Vladimir Golkov from the Technische Universitat Munchen. His talk centered primarily around the mathematics behind deep learning and inverse problems and the applications this could have on modern day research. The latter part of the discussion was about neural networks and data visualization.
