<strong>Shubham Pansari</strong>, Electronics and Communication engineer, completed his B.Tech from Manipal Institute of Technology in 2015. After 10 months in KPMG, Bangalore, he is now doing his post-graduation from IIM Ahmedabad.

<em>“The CAT paper has eased out in the last couple of years, making speed the major differentiating factor at higher percentiles, as students tend to get a high percentage of questions correct. The pattern requires emphasis on pretty much everything because of that, as ‘can-be-left’s are in the picture anymore. My personal opinion for preparation for CAT is intense practice through Mock Tests instead of solving through books. It helps one practise at the required speed and builds concentration span. Also, one should go through their solutions to learn new and faster methods of solving questions.”</em>

<strong>Means for preparation</strong>

There are two institutes offering coaching for CAT in Manipal, namely, Byju’s and TIME. But you can always join an online coaching too.

<em>“I couldn't join any classes for CAT along with my job at KPMG. I enrolled in a Test Series with Career Launcher for CAT, and again with CL for interview preparation. I referred to the books of Prof Arun Sharma for some basics in Verbal and Quant.</em>

<em>Arun Sharma's books are easily available in bookstores/e-­commerce websites. There is a lot of online material available, but it is advisable to join a reputed test series, which helps you to prepare by timing the questions, comprehensive solutions and a way to track progress.”</em>

<strong>On what points are students mostly evaluated in the interview? </strong>

“<em>Once CAT is cleared, the competition gets fierce as everyone seems to be just as good or better. It is of paramount importance that preparation for the interview is meticulously done. I would urge CAT aspirants to develop a habit of reading newspapers and magazines, and form opinions on major issues in the social, political, economic and technological spheres – the aim is to be able to have 5 minute conversations on these topics with your interviewer. One must be thorough with a few undergraduate subjects, especially those without work experience.”</em>

<em>“For B Schools, students are typically evaluated in 4 departments. Undergraduate studies, work experience, current affairs and career questions. Current affairs include a lot more of presenting and defending one's stand on any issue, than just knowing the facts. Career questions are mostly about long and short term goals, aligning past and future works with the goals, "Why MBA?", etc.</em>”

<strong>What questions were you asked in your interview?</strong>

<em>Across interviews, I was asked roughly the following:</em>

<em>1. Why MBA? What are your long term/short term goals? How have you worked towards the goals so far?</em>
<em>2. Why go to manipal all the way from Kolkata? </em>
<em>3. What was your favorite subject during undergrad? They asked some questions on my favorite subject.  IIML people asked random questions without asking my favorite subject.</em>
<em>4. Current affairs. US Elections, Europe immigration issues, JNU, etc</em>
<em>5.What challenges did you face at work? How did you handle them? How did you improve the conditions? How would you handle it now?</em>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Top Universities / Colleges:</strong></li>
</ul>
<em>“The tier 1 colleges for me would be IIM A, IIM B and IIM C, closely followed by XLRI, FMS and ISB. ISB admits through GMAT, XLRI through XAT, while others through CAT. Apart from these, leading colleges are IIM L, IIM K, IIM I, SP Jain, JBIMS, and MDI.</em>
