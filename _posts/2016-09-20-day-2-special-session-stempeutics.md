The second day of IGCLA 2016 drew to a close with a special lecture on Stem Cell Therapy by Dr Raviraja N S, Centre Head Stempeutics Research pvt. ltd., Manipal. He spoke at length about the various types of stem cells and their applications. He also spoke about how Stempeutics was the first company in India to have received clearance for therapeutic use of their products. He then proceeded to share details about preparation of stem cell pools and how the final product works, with the help of study results in Critical Limb Ischemia and Osteoarthritis. It was a very interesting talk which provided insight into a less thought about aspect of medicine.
