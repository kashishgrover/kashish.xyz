The basics are often have the most versatile of applications and efficacy of effects. For sports medicine, one increasingly essential skill is that of the judicious application of tape. The IGCLA conducted workshop on taping served as a primer on the subject, introducing the motive, method and objectives of taping. Further, it provided a glimpse into more advanced methods, such as the KinesioTape in wide use at the Rio Olympics. The practical demonstrations and valuable advice rounded out the workshop.
