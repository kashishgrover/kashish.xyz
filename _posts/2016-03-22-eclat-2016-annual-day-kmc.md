The warm weekend afternoon of 19<sup>th</sup> March, 2016 saw KMC Greens filled with dapper men and genteel women, gathered for the much awaited College Day. Rightly named ‘Éclat’, the evening celebrated KMC’s exceptional heritage and dynamism.

Our chief guest for the evening was a world renowned name in Reproductive medicine and andrology, Prof. Dr. Stefan Schlatt from the University of Münster, Germany. Guests of honour included our very own leaders, Dr. Ramdas M Pai (President and Chancellor), Dr. H.S.Ballal (Pro Chancellor) and Dr. Vinod H. Bhat (Vice Chancellor), along with Dr. Poornima Baliga (Dean of KMC) and our distinguished panel of Associate Deans. The event was also joined by our reputed faculty, postgraduates, interns, students across all semesters and parents.

The evening kicked off with an exuberant cultural parade with students displaying flags of multiple nations portraying the essence of a multi-cultural education hub that Manipal is. Dr. Pragna Rao then addressed the gathering. Late Dr. T.M.A Pai was fondly remembered for his pioneering contributions by offering a beautiful floral tribute. Dr. Poornima Baliga took to the podium to acknowledge various arenas of work and development at KMC. While presenting the annual report of KMC and Kasturba Hospital, she also outlined the core principles to strive hard in the direction of the 20/20 vision in healthcare. Following this, the president of the Student Council, Mr. Sue Hong Lee outlined the visions and achievements of the Student Council. Prof. Dr.Stefan Schlatt took over from him for what proved to be an impactful speech. He started out by greeting us all in German and cited events from the past and present to portray the strong Indo-German relationship. This was succeeded by the guests of honour awarding gold medals and certificates to the best students as an acknowledgment to their outstanding academic performance and excellence in extra-curricular activities. The best faculty members were also awarded for their exuberant way of teaching, on the basis of an online survey which included students from all the semesters.

Then came the part which everyone eagerly awaited, the Cultural extravaganza. Apart from the delicious free food (and of course, attendance!), this was one of the main attractions for attending the college day. Faculty members and students showcased their talents in the form of musical medley, dance performances and a skit. A German folk song  was rendered by the chief guest and his colleagues which was indeed a pleasant surprise.

It was followed by a classical performance which was astonishingly led by the Dean herself. Then came a mellifluous medley of old and new Bollywood songs and dance performances on foot-tapping numbers. The highlight of the event was a skit ‘What If’ presented by the faculty, which was based on the concept of what would they have become if they hadn’t got into the profession of medicine.
