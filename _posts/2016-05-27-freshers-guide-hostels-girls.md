Hostels. That is a veritable question that comes into everyone’s heads. Even before you’ve embarked on your academic journey to become an engineer, you wish to know about the accommodation provided by the college, the comfort quotient, whether it’s worth your money and most importantly, if you’re ready to call it your second home. MTTN has brought you a comprehensive guide to the blocks available exclusively for first years. Make the correct choice, because you’re about to move into this place for an entire year- and trust me when I say this, you will find few of your lifelong friends right here.

&nbsp;

<ul>
	<li><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;">12</span><sup style="line-height: 24px;">th</sup><span style="font-size: 16px; line-height: 24px;"> Block</span></li>
</ul>
</span>
<ol></ol>
Located right around the Venugopal Temple, and far away from the Academic Blocks, this block boasts of lush greenery around it.&nbsp; In spite of being comfortable, and exclusively for freshers, the only catch about this block is its distance.

Each hostel provides a cot, a mattress, a study table and a chair in addition to the cupboards. Other hostel staff include the cleaners and the care takers. Hostels cannot be changed in between the semesters.

It might take you quite a while to get accustomed to staying in one corner of the room which you will make your own, but hostel life has its own charm. Being worried about things like who’s going to be your roommate, whether you can adjust with her, will you like the food and so on, will take a backseat when you start living your life here. Embrace hostel life, seize the chance to make some amazing friends, have those 3 am conversations, let yourself feel the adrenaline rush to make it by perm time and definitely make all those experiences count. Hope this helps you make your decision. For any queries, ask us in the comment section below.
