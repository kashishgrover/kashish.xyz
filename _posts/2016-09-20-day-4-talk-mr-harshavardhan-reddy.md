The last talk of the morning session was by Mr Harshavardhan Reddy. His topic was “Photonics for Health Care: A Lab on Fiber”. He spoke about the concept of a ‘lab on a chip’ which are devices that integrate various laboratory functions on a chip. According to his research, a photonic chip is more sensitive than an electronic one due to its higher number of measurable parameters such as wavelength, colour etc. compared to the single measurable unit in electronic chips i.e. .voltage. Also photonic chips are seen to work reliably in aqueous solutions and have lesser risks to biological samples. These chips may be used in industrial machines to test product quality and check for leaks, monitor waterways, and survey oceans. Eventually they may also be used to look for disease and metabolism of drugs in the human body in the future.
